dzv0fwa	Google Assistant fired a gun: We need to talk	Read your own post.  &gt;On the surface, the footage is underwhelming -- nothing visually arresting is really happening. But peel back the layers even a little, and it's obvious this project is meant to provoke a conversation on the boundaries of what AI should be allowed to do.  &gt;...  &gt;He's no stranger to artwork featuring the abilities of artificial intelligence. Reben has created projects that show what AI hears and sees when exposed to "The Joy of Painting," as well as hiding tiny artworks in URLs. This, however is an even more provocative piece that forces the viewer to imagine what could happen if nefarious programmers made an AI that went rogue. Now, more than ever, we need to have the discussions about how, and if, we can prevent an intelligent machine from killing us all.	What? This is not an art project at all.	Did nobody read the article? This was just an art project.	None	0
e0fpo62	Underpaid and exhausted: the human cost of your Kindle - In the Chinese city of Hengyang, we find a fatigued, disposable workforce assembling gadgets for Amazon, owned by the world’s richest man.	$10 per month is no longer cheap imo.	Amazon offers a service that no one else does (on the same level)  The fast cheap shipping is why I think they are so popular.	Just go down the street in China and you find ALL the big corps. Not really necessary to just call out Amazon.  I wish i had the money to afford more expensive products so i wouldn't need to buy from amazon, but man, the world is a cruel place right now.	You’re entitled to that opinion. But clearly others think it is worth it.  Given Spotifyor Netflix  is the same price, but only has music or video, I can see how people think Prime is a good deal.  But it’s all in the eye of the spender.	0

e17892q	I'd like to get opinions on what's to be done in the USA	Protesting is for pussies tho (like free speech warriors), general strikes are where its at.	Spread class consciousness and unionize everything. Americans are conditioned to think that protesting is for pussies and that the system is fair (i.e., I don't need to participate in a union, because I can get mine without one) while somehow also hating the government and having little faith in public institutions.  Until we can get more of the population to shake off that spell, I don't think there is much we can do.	None	Lol	0
e1z9n9g	My MIL ruined Disneyland for my daughter	I got glutened at Epcot. It wasn't a Disney owned restaurant technically (it's some business that partners with Disney) but Disney customer service was still very interested in my complaint.  The waiter lied to me because he was a douchebag. Apparently he had "life altering auto immune disorder" confused with "silly weightloss diet".	Disney is super careful about allergies. Like they err on the side of caution. If you mention an allergy, even a minor one the chef will come out to talk to you about it in more detail. They have special places to prepare food for guests with allergies. My best friend has a deathly rice allergy and Disney is the only place besides her house and mine that she feels truly safe eating at. They would have taken care of your daughter and made sure no allergens would be anywhere near her food.  Source: former cast member who worked in a quick serve restaurant.	None	[deleted]	0

e1zafo3	UPDATE: I’m putting my foot down so hard that my heels are being licked my the flames of hell	You can google list of emotions. That's how I found it.	Wow!! The list of emotions sounds amazing! Would you be able to send me a link to it? I have a friend who's fresh outta rehab and I am trying to be a support in her not using. 	This is a woman who *thrives* on her role as a codependent enabler.   Also, you hit the nail on the head how she uses the word “sad” over and over and doesn’t have a proper emotional vocabulary. At rehab, we were required to choose veeeery specific words (as were family members on family night) to express our emotions. “Great” and “fine” were not allowed because they were too vague. (My counselor said emphatically that “fine” stood for “fucked in nearly everything” or “freaked out, insecure, neurotic, and emotional”.) They even handed us a huuuuuuge list of words, well over 100 deep, that gave extremely specific emotion words.  **You guys handled it perfectly. She handled it the worst possible way imaginable.**  Stay. Strong. And keep saying NO. 	for some reason I assumed it'd be harder, lol. I found Byron Katie's website with its list, which I trust!	0
e1zb1nq	MILITW: You'd better eat what I paid for! A story from my buffet days	How can somebody just sit there and bitch at a child about their eating habits? Narcissist is right.	I was always overweight as a kid. About the time i turned 10 I realized it myself and had developed sensitivity to it. Other kids in class nade comments, a soccer mom on my team badgered me nonstop about it, and my Nmom was pretty vocal about how much bigger my pants were getting. So yeah, I was very fucking aware of having become the fat kid.  I liked going to the buffet for family dinners because I could get a filling salad or lots of veggies and maybe some soup. I was actively trying to eat healthy and make the right choices. One time we took my paternal grandparents woth us. That grandma is very much a justno/narcissist. She made comments all through the meal about my choices and how it didn't make sense that I was still so heavy.  I was crushed. That's when i started emotionally eating. Thanks, grandma. 	I would of cut a bitch. Teaching kids to over eat is a horrible thing to do. Then people wonder why childhood obesity is on the rise.	The same kind of grandparents who will eat lobster in front of kids who love it and force them to eat hot dogs instead. 	0
e1zxi8v	I'm A What Now?	Your BF needs some serious therapy. When he gets out and you have your first argument, he's going to fall back on his coping mechanisms from growing up. Maybe he won't tell you anything is wrong and keep everything to himself. Then a couple of months later, the blowup. He needs to learn how to get in touch with his emotions and dismantle his coping mechanisms he developed to deal with growing up in an emotionally abusive environment.   Pete Walker's book CPTSD: From Surviving to Thriving might help him. He has a website where he summarizes a lot of the concepts from the book.	He made excuses, but only because he didn't know what she was doing was abnormal. He spoke with his friends who confirmed they always had their doubts about his mother, but never tried to say anything. They confirmed that normal mothers are not like this. He was very, very confused and upset to find out that not all mothers don't try to stunt you socially and take extreme measures in terms of keeping tabs. He was deeply upset by the revelation.	You already knew she was fucked up.  Given the depth of her extreme pathology, you likely will never be able to have anything more than extremely low contact relationship with her. She's clearly a bundle of headsnakes. You do need to think hard about what bf is going to be like over the next few years as he disentangles from his highly toxic family - you don't live with that much fuckery for 20 something years and walk out unscathed. You indicated he was making excuses for her a very short while ago. I would suggest you proceed with caution.	None	0
e1zyl1n	Future MIL asks us to change our wedding date to better accommodate golden child sister.	Some psychologists say that the training regime of the military and the structure inculcate personality disorders in those who are vulnerable. It's deliberately traumatic. (Same thing with modern police training. Didn't used to be this way but since the 1990s they've made police training deliberately traumatizing, which may be a factor in increased police involved shootings.)	Husband is currently military, I know many terrible people through his job, usually the military makes them worse because entitlement. Example of a terrible person: we were hanging out with one of his friends and their friends last week, husbands friend (we'll call him T) and his friend (let's say Joe) decided to walk to taco bell across the street. They discovered that the dining room was closed, tried to walk through the drive thru, were denied because of safety reasons, reasonable right? They come back, T drives over there, heavily intoxicated, is still upset, tells us when he gets back with food that one of the slushies he ordered is missing because he threw it at the cashier..... I was shocked and left pretty soon after that	Ugh, I hate the whole military=hero thing. Guess what? Shitty people join too, yeah, sometimes the military straightens them out, but not always, and not the ones who join for the power- real or perceived- it gives them. I can respect the soldier (whatever other term, I'm not familiar) but find the person absolutely abhorrent.  &nbsp;  For example, I loathe my sister's ex (nephews sperm donor), but I respect that he was military. On the other hand , my sister's Fiance is an awesome person and I truly believe he is worthy of being called a hero (mainly because he would not consider himself one) and I respect him on all fronts. Sorry got a bit carried away.   &nbsp;  Good on you for not budging. And congrats on the wedding!	Very interesting. Thanks for that info	0
e1zyocz	Future MIL asks us to change our wedding date to better accommodate golden child sister.	Sherman doesn't belong in that lineup. Burning down the buildings in Atlanta was the ultimate in "play bitch games, win bitch prizes". Who picked that fight again?  Gen Petraeus who was fucking his hagiographer in violation of UCMJ is a good example though. Who retains a hagiographer in the first place? Hmm, think he wanted to run for high office himself.	Dont forget there have been plenty of assholes in the military.   McArthur, who thought he was more important than the president.   McDowell the coward who traipsed around Washington for months instead of fighting the Civil War.  Sherman who some Southerners would want lynched if he was alive today.  All of them military, and maybe 1 of them is a hero.	Bitch needs to **stay in her goddamned lane.**   Also, someone being in the military does not automatically make them a saint. Yes, we appreciate their service — but if someone was a dick before they donned the uniform, was a dick while they wore the uniform, and continues to be a dick now that the uniform is off, then guess what. **They’re just a dick.** 	None	0

e2afin6	What do you think of the mentally retarded?	This is a very true statement. Though I personally work with individuals who factually cannot work enough to make a living wage for a variety of reasons (though they do try and earn a little) I agree that those of higher functioning are indeed able to do more. While I specifically work with mental retardation I also see autism and less severe developmental disabilities and of the two groups they can do some pretty amazing things. I'm happy that one of our departments runs a program for autistic individuals to help them gain work skills and learn what they are good at which allows them to live far more independently.   So I completely agree with your sentiment.	I've spent quite a lot of time in the company of people with mental function variations and I feel about them like I feel about pretty much anyone else. They are people with different traits. The only sweeping generalization I can make if forced to say something about people with mental function variations as a group is that they generally are under utilized. Many of them have what it takes to do an ordinary job but sadly few are utilized that way.	None	None	0
e2ago2v	Does intelligence effect the ability to cook?	I laughed. I must be easy.	Well, I'd hate to admit to knowing any stupid cooks, so I'll refer you to a stupid eater.  A group of us were eating at a seafood restaurant in NYC.  There was a clam menu featuring a great many preparations of clams, and I believe all of us ordered some type of clam.  A short while after we're served, a friend named "Dan" stated he didn't like his clams, and was passing them off to whoever wanted them.  "What's wrong with your clams, Dan?"  "They're raw."  "What did you order, Dan?"  "The raw clams."  "Why did you order raw clams, Dan?"  "I thought they were cooked."  The moral of the story is that perhaps Dan should not be a cook.    	None	None	0

ek1xm70	Pete Buttigieg's father was a Marxist professor who lauded the Communist Manifesto	   “The question to me is how do we arrest the decline in the perception of the court toward being viewed as a nakedly political institution.”  One idea that should be at least reviewed, he said, is increasing the number of justices from nine to 15 and perhaps rotating justices to the high court from the appellate level.  He said he finds “most intriguing” a structure in which five justices are appointed by Democratic presidents, five are appointed by Republican presidents, and then those 10 justices must unanimously agree on appointing the five additional justices, who would come from the appellate bench.  He said the idea was put forward by the Yale Law Journal.  “It takes the politics out of it a little bit, because we can’t go on like this where every time there’s a vacancy, there’s these games being played and then an apocalyptic ideological battle over who the appointee is going to be,” Buttigieg said.

He thinks being gay will get him enough oppression points to run but he's too white, too male, and too he doesn't want to chop his cock off.

epyityh	looking for a new laptop	It's better than each of the other two for a student. You didn't answer about your major.	I actually havent looked into the T480. How is it compared to the others?? My budget is around 1.6k.	Neither of those is the best choice for durability and upgradability. What about a T480? What's your major and budget?  You should buy directly under discount, and upgrade the warranty either at purchase it within the first year. You'll want at least three year premier (i.e. next day on site) support.	Oh sorry, pharmacy so not gonna need that much crazy specs. Might look into dj or music stuff for fun here and there but 99% for school	0
epzok62	looking for a new laptop	It's not "bulky" lol. What crazy hyperbole. It's just a way more capable, robust machine, especially for a student.	I went with the x1 because it's lighter and with matte screen. I would not go with the 480, way too bulky.	None	It weights like 50% more, that's a lot more. I think it really depends if you need the additional features. I went for portability.	0
eqgyx4b	Was happy to receive my first ThinkPad which is a T450. eBay posting was wrong and listed it as a 1920x1080 display and I knew right away it wasn’t.	I'd recommend against keeping the machine. Upgrading the screen will be difficult, especially tracking down a display on the whitelist.   (How do I know? I have a T450 with an FHD IPS screen that has broken brightness control in Windows. I did all the homework to track down the right panel, only to have the vendor nevertheless send me a non-whitelisted one... at least I got to keep the panel for free, but it's still annoying.)	Im hoping I can negotiate a rebate because Id prefer to keep the machine and upgrade the screen myself	So if it was advertised with the 1080p screen, but doesn't have that, you could get a refund and return it - "not as described" - or, contact the vendor and negotiate a rebate.

eqhgmqa	Makes no sense!	I mean, you can clearly see resistance and support are a real phenomenon, as are their various triangles. The issue is just that you don't know which lines are going to be observed until after the fact.	I roll my eyes every time a butter talks about resistances and falling wedges or whatever. TA is a complete caricature of real math.	None	Humans enter and exit the order book, creating patterns people call resistance and support. When a small percentage of actors control a large percentage of liquidity then this becomes meaningless. A large sell or buy order will absorb the available liquidity and result in an outlier up or down move.  A large number of small actors trying to game the perceived pattern also introduce noise. It's like fools betting on tea leaves making side bets on the size of the bets other people are making on the same tea leaves.	0
eqkaivv	Does Thinkpad X1 Extreme 4K have problem with downscale to full hd 1080p ?	This is untrue in my direct knowledge. Interpolation results in fuzziness at FHD.	It scales down to 1080p just fine	None	Depends on how you downscale. Game res change vs display res change can affect fuzziness.	0

erwb8qg	ThinkPad X390: real-world impressions	 ...  making them poorly sorted to a wide range of tasks, yes.	As with any tech purchase it's a balance of advantages and compromises. While the T480 has unquestionably more headroom for future upgrades than the X390, the X390 unquestionably surpasses the T480 in size, weight and panel quality.   I knew I would be betting on 16GB being sufficient for the next 5 years but it doesn't seem all that unreasonable to me. The vast majority of notebooks being sold today by the likes of Dell and HP, even in the high-midrange segment, still ship with 8GB with no option to spec up.	I just couldn't buy one because of the RAM hobbling, and your mention of performance needs means you may well find 16GB limiting. The lowly T480 offers quadruple the memory with further a good possibility in the future, making it unquestionably more future-proof.	Absolutely. So it is hoped that 16GB will provide enough headroom for at least the next half decade, and there's no reason in my mind as to why it shouldn't, considering that my 2015 Mac with 8GB would have been good for a few more years if not for its other hardware failings.	0

Sure, that is called scarcity, you gotta make yourself a "scarce" resource. That is assuming everyone has a fair chance at the start to make that choice if they want to.   BUT how can you make yourself a scarce resource if you grow up poor? Black? etc...If you start out on hard mode in life then its an uphill battle from the start. It's not actually as simple as "find something unique". Basically its another way of saying "pull yourself up by your bootstraps". It's a disingenuous argument if you discount the details of reality.   Also, If we have a permanent poor class that is inflexible then what are we even doing?	Wages always stagnate for zero-talent/zero skills/zero thought required labor.  Because a replacement drone can rotate in and do the work when the previous one doesn't hack it.

evrhfrn	Charles Barkley at Dem Debate: "Every Black Person I Know Has Always Voted Democratic - All Those People Are Still Poor"	And yet Clinton got 90% of the black vote.	I was working as a trucker in the weeks prior to the 2016 election.  I did a long stint along the I-10 corridor through Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.  I was shocked by the amount of black folks who were openly advocating for Trump.  Everyone I spoke with had pretty much the same idea:  the government didn't represent them, and the government never did anything for them but break promises, so maybe it was time to throw a wrench into the works.  That's a huge, and probably fatal, blow to the Democratic party.  I don't see those folks going back because of some pandering.	None	She got 90% of the black vote *as measured from exit polls.*  I live in a medium-population suburban area.  I have never in my 30 years of voting been approached by a pollster, or even seen one.  I have a couple of acquaintances who live in upscale urban areas who've seen them from time to time, but not consistently.  In more rural areas, they're utterly unheard of.  So, the big question is, who's gathering the data, and how?  Essentially, the statistic you're quoting just says that 90% of voters who actually encounter a pollster, who agree to be interviewed, and who identify their race as black voted for Clinton.    So, we really *don't* know what the racial, cultural, or economic demographics of voters in Pelahatchie, Shreveport, or Katy were like because the exit pollsters never bothered to go there.  A few college kids and retirees asked some people in a university town who they voted for, then extrapolated that to include the whole county or state.  You can see the obvious problems inherent in the approach, and the utter folly of gleaning any sort of useful information from the data collected.  The whole "uneducated white people" meme that CNN so gleefully pushed after the election is pure dishonesty.	0
ew1sz47	Out of the 27 deadliest mass shooters, 26 were fatherless. The tool is not the issue, the lack of community and care is. These people could have also used a vehicle to mow down many people. However, most stable people can't defend themselves with a vehicle if the need arises.	The thought is that woman stay in abusive relationships because of the societal pressure of maintaining the nuclear family model. I think that people should feel free to get out of bad situations. Yes, divorce can and does take a toll on the children though.	Progressives for the last half century: "Free love you guys, you don't **neeeed** a nuclear family. Family is whatever you want it to be. Family is love. We're all empowered to be parents, you don't **neeed** a husband. If your child acts out, just get them on some meds. YOU CAN do this alone. Girl power!

ewcwolf	NYT: Victoria’s Secret Casts First Openly Transgender Woman as a Model	Why should we decide who a company decides to hire. It’s their decision not anyone else’s.	I think that conservatives should resist the LGBT agenda at every step. This story is concerning because it represents something more dangerous than just what a quick read of the headline suggests. If there is any business market where "transgender women" should not be making inroads in modeling, this is it (for very obvious reasons). This story says something about how companies are now rolling out transgenders to make the larger culture consider them attractive. We should be very concerned about their soft coup of the culture spearheaded by liberal, corporate elites.	Okay...I mean, what do we care.    If a company wants to hire someone on merit or just for publicity, who are we to have a problem with that.  This is a non-story from a conservative perspective.	None	0

exhr6ip	Andrew Yang wants to Employ Blockchain in voting. "It’s ridiculous that in 2020 we are still standing in line for hours to vote in antiquated voting booths. It is 100% technically possible to have fraud-proof voting on our mobile phone"	Can you specifically talk about the weak links in a crypto based system? If there are any uses for the blockchain, then secure voting seems like one of those uses.   It solves several problems inherent to traditional electronic voting systems, such as havign to trust the party who holds the voting machines or servers code and hardware, allows anonymous verification of users votes, meaning any tampering at any point in the process can be discovered when people realise the recorded vote used for decisions is not the vote they made.   &amp;#x200B;  What, specifically, are the issues associated with blockchain voting, and what makes them unsolvable?	Absolutely. It is impossible to create fraud-proof electronic voting. There will always be a weak link in the chain. Even if the software itself is impossible to hack, there will be a human element to fool. But that's not the biggest issue. The biggest issue is that electronic voting introduces so many more security risks which would not be there in a paper vote system. Unless you somehow achieve 100% secure electronic voting, it will always be worse than paper voting.	Is what he said wrong?	Blockchain voting will not solve any of those issues. The biggest issue is the oracle problem. How do you verify that a given voter has only put in one vote? Do you use a third party service, like a database of voters? If you do, you ruin the secret ballots, allowing voters to be bullied into voting a certain way. Paper ballots allow anonymity which is very important. You also need to make sure the votes are accurate, maintain the security of the issue and prevent fraud.  Blockchain is going to do none of these things. Bad actors can still fake votes and with a blockchain based voting system, the votes would be immutable. Bad votes will be forever stored in the blockchain, never to be changed.	0

f33cgx4	'No regrets': Hong Kong Hearthstone gamer banned over pro-democracy support	Business and “personal” should mix and do mix.  If they didn’t mix:  Business getting a morality-exemption leads to exploitative behavior. Nestle giving baby formula to third world countries and jacking up the price once mothers stopped producing milk is an example. These behaviors have “personal” consequences and should therefore be “personal”-ly accountable.   Since they do mix:  You get whistleblowing. You get some form of institutionally-protected process for seeking justice and reparations. Business is a means by which society has developed to allow its citizens to seek a living, but societies (and their morality) existed before business and will exist after it.	They are a gaming company. They should have nothing to do with politics. The gamer broke their rules and is suffering the consequences.   We all witnessed loads of football players get fines because they kneeled during the anthem. Business and personal dont mix.	For Blizzard, whose headquarters are in Irvine, California, should be ashamed of themselves for kowtowing to an oppressive regime halfway across the world.   Thank you, Blizzard, for showing us your true colours.	Why would we look to blizzard for politics? It’s seems really fucking stupid to me. I agree What China is doing is wrong, but what does it have to do with blizzard and why should they be getting involved at all? A gamer representing their company made a political statement on their platform without their permission. Whether it’s for a good cause or not, he has not right to do that. Blizzard is just following protocol, he broke a rule and is suffering the consequences. Blizzard is not here to free Hong Kong, they’re here for our entertainment and to make money, nothing more.	0

By the words of their own founders they are condemned.   The truth can stand up in the light of any scrutiny. Falsehood withers and fades.	None	None	0

f6k9mv4	You do it	&gt; In reality, if all the money was pooled and teachers could buy wholesale then those dollars spent would go farther.  This really applies to every kind of charity, and kind of gets into the reason why charity as an alternative to an effective government safety net is not a great idea. It's inefficient and capricious.    We're not going to donate our way out of childhood hunger because the cause of childhood hunger is capitalism.	I was once a shift manager of an office supply store. We would have supply drives for kids and were encouraged to promote it. I remember a teacher saying that at least half the stuff they got wouldn't be used and they were still lacking critical supplies that no one thinks of.  Then it clicked for me, the customers were paying retail price for supplies they thought teachers needed. In reality, if all the money was pooled and teachers could buy wholesale then those dollars spent would go farther.	None	The cause of childhood hunger is not capitalism, but yes, the govt should still be a more efficient safety net than charity.	0

f9avd36	Thanks DSA. Very cool.	That's not what's happening.  The US will continue to elect more and more radical candidates until someone does something.  Trump got elected on a platform of populism versus Clinton (Status quo) and Sanders ("socialism").  Today Bernie doesn't go far enough so we have Yang in the mix as well, but the Overton window has shifted enough that Bernie is no longer "too fringe" and is not being completely shut out like Yang is.  Maybe in 2024 Yang or someone like him might get serious coverage.	Or  > Install DSA (socialist by name) candidate as US President   > 4 Years go by, no difference - still capitalism, Wall Street and imperialism because no revolution to dismantle capitalism and liquidate the bourgeoisie   > New Republican candidate elected president  > The whole of the US population is convinced the US had socialism for 4 years  > every time actual, Marxist socialism is mentioned as an alternative to capitalism:  > we already had socialism for 4 years and it never done any good  > the US population gives up on socialism, the real or opportunist kind because of opportunist liberals such as the DSA  Thanks DSA and left unity. Very cool, trendy revisionism.	I mean this stems entirely from the misapplication of the term "socialism" by the reactionary corporatist right than anything else. If you want the US to become Sweden and the right calls that socialist, then you embrace the term socialist to deny that angle.   Then the circular firing squad shows up and attacks *them* for not being *true* socialists, when it's actually the reactionary right that's misusing the term in the first place.	People didn't vote Trump to avoid Sanders. That's just not a thing. Sanders wasn't in the equation when that vote happened.	0
f9eo89q	Privatized healthcare incoming? Possibly something to watch (and resist) in the coming years.	The UCP literally just voted that the Canada Health Act is irrelevant. The official UCP party stance is now AGAINST the public health care system's requirements.  If you think they're not going to gut the public system, you're being naive brother.	There isn't any details on what the plan is, so everyone's opinion is conjecture at this point. The most possible outcome is this won't change anything from a public perspective. Most likely the changes would be that more for-profit options would become available in Alberta. You wouldn't have to pay for any of the service offered through the public system, which shouldn't change. The change would be people would have the option to pay out of pocket to go to a private clinic.  Edit: apparently I was wrong. We will cease to have universal healthcare by the end of December.	Could someone ELI5 to me what this could mean? I have a neurological condition that affects my eyes. Would this mean I would have to pay out of pocket to see a neurologist and ophthalmologist to treat it?!  Edit ~ not sure why I’m getting downvoted for asking a question lol	[removed]	0

f9f4o40	What is the likelihood of a general strike?	If Kenney doesn't back down with his anti-Canada anti-worker anti-sanity bullshit you're absolutely right.  Imagine a force with 156,000 AHS workers....33,000 more teachers....95,000 APS.  Marching the streets. Shutting down highways, railroads, airports, the legislature itself.  Kenney has no idea the dragon that has been awoken.	100% is my guess.	None	Not to mention ALL the other public sector workers who are sub contracted out.  The ems crew for northern Alberta is already starting to lean towards this position. The gullible ones expected increase in funding, the systems being slashed instead when it was already super under funded.  Don't piss off Paramedics. They will march.	0
f9f4rvl	What is the likelihood of a general strike?	It ain't lasting till 2021.  Frankly, it could come tomorrow for the anger out there.	With the way social media allows for mobilization, along with the dynamics of the "us v. them" mentality that is growing increasingly pervasive, I would predict a strike in 2021 for at least one if not two groups. Kenney is bad at optics and isn't placating anyone and doesn't give off the bumpkin Klein vibe.   UCP want to get the strikes over with now and if they don't happen now will I'm sure attempt to mitigate the damage they have done in 2021.   It's going to be really interesting.	None	None	0
f9f4tvh	What is the likelihood of a general strike?	Yeah, nobody is concerned about "contracts" - least of all the UCP.  We are in VERY dangerous territory. 250,000 unionized public workers marching in solidarity.	Im doubtful of a general strike, Im not even sure they can because the contracts have different renewal dates. I suppose some could wait without contract until they are all in legal position to strike but Im doubtful.  In my purely anecdotal personal opinion, Teachers only strike for Teachers, I wouldnt expect their support for UNA or AUPE. The UNA might support job action by AHS staff in AUPE, go to rallies or protests, maybe refuse to cross the line since they have the same employer, but Im not confident they would go full strike if AUPE does.	None	I’m glad you are pumped up.   I’ve been with AUPE since the early 90s, been to many conventions and held several positions over the years.  I know how important that momentum is.   Even if it’s a possibility AUPE strikes in April when their contract is up and next years budget cuts are announced, the chance of Teachers walking out with them is slim.  I’m happy to be proven wrong, but I seriously doubt it.	0
f9f4xad	What is the likelihood of a general strike?	Government workers will be right beside everyone else.  Hell, non-government unions may march.  If everyone actually went on a general strike at once, we could seriously be looking at the collapse of the UCP party. Imagine a quarter to a half million people shutting down Alberta until Kenney resigns and calls an election.	I can see teachers and healthcare workers going on strike before government employees do. If that happens, I"m screwed.	None	I kind of get the feeling that a strike would fall on deaf ears. He doesn't seem to really care.	0
f9f6xqn	Braid: Kenney says Albertans won’t like threat of a general strike	Its simple, should it happen.  Don't go to work. Join the rest on picket lines.  That's it. You've now gotten involved.  The governing bodies will be "officially" denouncing the wildcat and illegal action (while likely providing support from the sidelines)	How can I get involved in a general strike? Are there any organizations that I can work with? I imagine that the governing bodies of the impacted unions will be averse to illegal strike actions.	None	Yea but a general strike isn't just tons of people all individually deciding to walk out of their jobs on a particular day. There would have to be groups organizing rallies and building support far in advance. Are there any organizations that are building support for this? How can I get involved beyond just supporting this in theory?	0

fa0sii5	Indiana farmer goes off to Roosevelt!	The New Deal was instrumental to the golden age of the 50s and 60s.  Not sure why you would disparage it when the decline of the US since then was precisely because the gains made were eroded by a resurgence of economic liberalism, aka neoliberalism.	So glad to see leftists finally turning on FDR and the new deal. the new deal is an example of what happens when leftists back down the second they make any progress. When the ruling class flinches you don't accept that as a victory, you take that as a sign to attack even harder.	None	The gains were designed to be eroded, that's my criticism. It was the ruling class offering a false olive branch to the masses, the minimum necessary temporary appeasement to avoid a full on socialist revolution. Radical leftists at the time tried to make this point but were shouted down by reformist leftists who thought this was a win. History has shown the radicals to be right.   The ruling class has a very long outlook. They are more than happy to offer temporary appeasement, even for decades, if it ensures their long term hegemony. Radicals understand this and have a similarly long outlook. Reformists think in terms of what small improvements can be made today, and that's why their achievements never last.  Also "the golden age" is a manufactured myth and whatever truth it has was only true for a small subset of the white population.	0
fa6fclj	Say what you will, I find Sam's latest monetisation strategy to be very-- (rest of sentence only available to paying subscribers)	kids gotta go to harvard :P	The weirdest thing about all this is that Sam Harris should be above this.  Sam Harris has had exposure to moral teachings on altruism and he must know about the modern perspective on knowledge/information being a public good.  We all just accept that a person may choose to charge as much as he wants for his time but that isn't actually a given. It's a philosophical position that can be argued over.  Richard Dawkins, on his latest JRE appearance, proudly described how he and his atheist colleagues are having great impacts in the Middle East because the internet enabled the access to their ideas. We all probably think that's a good development. And it's a development that's possible because there is no pay wall.  Imagine if all these countless YouTube videos back then were behind a pay wall.

But for real, working with mollys is fucking risky especially when you're outgunned and exposed with a target on your back.  And I watched a ton of protest footage. The "fire mages" weren't nearly as destructive or violent as you might think. They were pretty much just used to keep the police back and hold ground. They generally showed more restraint than the riot police.	> Posting this not for glorifying the use of molotovs in protesting  > Frontliners including the "fire mages" are considered to be the bravest among all.  Uhh...	Source is from a Hong Kong photographer on Instagram (ID: eddie\_lammm).  Posting this not for glorifying the use of molotovs in protesting but simply because of Eddie's awesome work.  In fact, pyros are only a tiny portion of the protesters in Hong Kong. People choose different roles in the movement, whatever suits them best. Some take part as an overwatch, some are first aiders and some are journalists. Frontliners including the "fire mages" are considered to be the bravest among all. In a dense city like Hong Kong, cameras are everywhere and it is very easy to get caught for breaking the law. They risk at minimum 10 years to life in jail for throwing molotovs and so they have the biggest respect from all freedom fighters in Hong Kong.

Moldy then went to the aircraft carrier and told everyone on the ship that the fired Captain Cozier because he was *"[stupid and naive...](https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2020/04/06/navy-secretary-modly-coronavirus-audio-starr-lead-vpx.cnn)"*  The next day, Moldy was *actually* fired for being "stupid and naive."	Acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly is the [512th person](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qw7uAkCag7FPX6qI9pBAAzi1a4sgyD3k5xvleIOwL-s/edit?usp=sharing) to leave the Trump administration since the beginning.  Modly is the 4th Secretary of the Navy Trump has had in less than 4 years. Only one of those, Richard Spencer, was confirmed by the Senate. In comparison, Obama had 3 Naval secretaries - one acting and two permanent - in 8 years.  Edit: forgot to add - Modly served 13.6 Mooches, if his resignation is accepted effective today	None	0

fncit82	India Is No Longer India	Hindia	>Ensuring all immigrants seeking citizenship hold similar values of free expression and a secular basis for the rule of law is not.   Modi is not a secularist. He believes that Hindis are gods chosen followers. He comes from the same people who believe that British rule was good and that Ghandi ruined things. The thinking that the British killed Muslims and so that makes them inherently good	Banning Islamic citizenship is dumb.  Ensuring all immigrants seeking citizenship hold similar values of free expression and a secular basis for the rule of law is not.

If they are mostly fundamentalists, that could be a large social issue that India is ill equipped to deal with, hence the easy but unethical path of bans on citizenship.	None	0

foekcco	If you have a broken Samsung phone, Samsung is offering free repairs for first responders trough June 30 2020. Not spam, this is Samsung.com official website.	Great point but I think we all have sensitive things in our smartphones these days and for those of us who do, we always have our phones password protected, so if a Samsung authorized repair shop replaced a screen or a battery for free, the second the phone comes back to life it's still going to ask for your password anyways.   In any case I imagine that there will be people that can afford a $900 new phone, and there will be others that will prefer the free repair.	I know you posted this earlier and it got pulled. The issue with first responders is they often have sensitive work related information on their phones. This program isn't Samsung fixing the phones in house, it's through un-vetted service locations. Glancing about at some of the location they look like the people doing the repairs are basically those mall kiosk phone repair places.	None	By sensitive information I mean information that can land the owner of the phone in legal hot water if that information because public. It's also not a matter of what a repair location probably will do when it comes to security. It's what would a person be able to do if they wanted to with this sensitive information containing device. There are plenty of relatively quick and simple data recovery methods that will bypass password locks on phones.	0

My family would always tell me I needed to shop at Fred Meyer its so much better quality items.  Im in the clothes section at Fred Meyer looking at socks and what not.

Im not trying to hype a Walmart I know they are a terrible company. But at least your not getting charged $10+ more for the same low quality stuff.

fp5ocpe	When JW's talk about how all other religions are false...	As the OP suggested, keep the conversation to other religions first. It’s called “the outsider test”. So instead of focusing on 1914, look up prophecies from other religions and ask why he thinks they aren’t true. When he answers, apply his same logic to JW prophecies.	Tried a form of this logic with my PIMI Dad. He referred to "All the accurate prophecies!" "Like 1914?" "YES!"

fp5osan	When JW's talk about how all other religions are false...	I respect the need for the idea, and people’s right to have it, but honestly I think the word God and any related concepts are pointless and ultimately harmful. It’s unnecessary at best and fatal at worst.	1. I think God exists.  Just not Biblegod.      2. I think what we call "God" only scratches the surface, and religion scratches the surface of what we call "God".     3. I believe in Barach Spinoza's God.   All Gods are either rough interpretations of Spinoza's God, or stupid people believing a personification of an allegory of nature and reality itself is an actual, real thing.  4. Once you figure out that all healthy, mainstream religions are just a way for people to understand spirituality, and not to be taken literally...  It makes sense.   We didn't see it sooner because we belonged to a literalist faith led by con men.	None	It's probably because of the last 2 points I made.

Ask your parents why this person should think the Hindu gods aren’t real.  Now, apply their logic to Jehovah.  Rinse, repeat and enjoy.	i don't think i get it.  Wouldn't a JW just say that those other Gods **do indeed** exist: they're all Satan?  I just think of how scared my JW parents were of "demons".  It's all very real to these people, they don't critically analyse any story they hear, everything is true to them ("it's just Satan"), iirc my parents even think Aliens/UFOs are real and they're demons too.  i don't think they'd understand what "standards of proof" are.	None	ye, Street Epistemology.  iirc when confronted with what you said (re: "Unconvinced") - they end up falling back on *"god decides who is receptive to his message".*  ie: they don't think truth-vs-fiction is of importance, it's pretty cray.

fp7blkw	"capitalism is destroying the planet and creates more pain, suffering and death than all wars combined."	This is going to sound insane, because it is, but the newest trend becoming dominant on the commie sections of the internet is that "Communism may have killd 100m people in the 20th century, but capitalism killed 1 billion"   I thought it was satirical memery at first, but they are straight faced making this argument in some of their own circles, counting just about everything that caused a death as the result of capitalism that allegedly wouldn't have happened if they were truly communist nations.  Lots of references to bizarre examples in Africa and other 3rd world countries with despotic and genocidal governments, which obviously has nothing to do with capitalism, but they count it nevertheless.  They do the same with other things, like if someone dies because of heart disease, they try to make the case that under a "better" communist system they wouldn't have died from lifestyle diseases or something.

State capitalism is when the state owns the means of production. Not the people.  The USSR, by nature, had the means of production owned by State, not the people.   so no, the USSR and China arent communist.

fuvb2cb	The neoliberal era is ending. What comes next?	&gt; What is happening now, is that the destruction of union power and globalism mean the middle classes are going back to how they were before, renters on survival wages, and the aristocracy (billionaires) and middle class (small business owners, small time landlords) are also going back to where they were.  It meas the middle class has been exported. It's been growing in other countries.	The middle class as we know it were a result of unions and consumerism.   Before, the three classes were the aristocracy (lords and land owners), the middle classes (factory owners and those with capital) and the workers (mostly people who rented and lived on survival wages).  First, unions won higher wages and leisure time for the working classes, and then the economy centred itself around the workers. Workers with free money, time and assets are now what we think of as middle class.  What is happening now, is that the destruction of union power and globalism mean the middle classes are going back to how they were before, renters on survival wages, and the aristocracy (billionaires) and middle class (small business owners, small time landlords) are also going back to where they were.  Imagine the 1800s with smartphones and electric cars, thats our future.	It's not ending, it's accelerating and will, as a result, transform into something not recognizable as neoliberalism.  However, it won't be due to "ending" and then starting something new.  For instance, the return of manufacturing to the west isn't an end, it's a next logical step in a long-standing trend of automation that started over 100 years ago.  The take down of the landed aristocracy, the growth of the middle class, and then the subsequent hollowing out of the middle class are part of the same movements with the same causes - automation being primary.

fwb8m5l	How a party spent decades making itself white.	&gt; They want to restore what used to be the status quo.   They want to restore an *imagined* status quo.	>The problem with conservatism and minorities is that, at its core, conservatism is about maintaining social and political institutions.  That is what the name would make you think. But my experience with conservatives and conservatism has led me to believe that that is wrong. They don't want to maintain the status quo. They want to restore what used to be the status quo. So they still can't appeal to minority voters. But for slightly different reasons. People who want to maintain the status quo wouldn't be talking about abolishing the IRS or privatizing the postal service.[https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/3/8/18250087/the-reactionary-mind-trump-conservatism-corey-robin](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/3/8/18250087/the-reactionary-mind-trump-conservatism-corey-robin)	>“They’d better wake up to the necessity of doing it,” Rove said. “It’s a lost opportunity if we don’t.”  >It’s not the first time Republicans have heard that sort of thing. But apparently it’s hard advice to take.  I thought it was really smart for them to go straight from this quote to Republicans saying the same thing back in 1968.   The problem with conservatism and minorities is that, at its core, conservatism is about maintaining social and political institutions. When those institutions are entrenched in white supremacy, then you end up maintaining the tools of white supremacy.  Minorities for the most part do not want the status quo. The status quo has meant oppression. So conservatives have to look elsewhere for political success. Whether it is appealing to racists or disenfranchising minorities. They will try everything before changing who they are as a party.	How do you figure?	0
fwq2zt1	Whats the ratio of Shrute Bucks to Shekels?	It's not the professors, it's the backroom deals between publishers and university bookstores. Where you should be concerned with professors is when the required textbook was written by them, creating a conflict of interests.	I worked while in college back in the 90's and a semester of work barley paid for my books. I can only imagine how bad it is now. Also fuck professors who change their books every year so students can't buy used books and have buy the professors new edition so he can make more money	None	Textbook publishers are the worst. I'm an academic librarian, and every semester we buy copies of the textbooks that the profs are using. This upcoming term, we're 100% online thanks to COVID, so we've been trying to get ebooks of the textbooks, but the big publishers just...won't sell them to us. They literally refuse to sell copies of their ebooks to libraries, because that would potentially give students greater access, and they are greedy assholes.

You would rather a child die of the pox or the plague than be an embarrassment to the family.	People were rightfully skeptical as it was rumored that old man Gates, that mad scientist down the road, was trying to insert a mind-controlling abacus into each vaccine.	None	I know you are making a joke, but the reality is old vaccines are very different then they are today. You could actually could get the diseases from vaccine back then because what they uses was basically dead puss from pox sores to innoculate people with a dead/deactivated form of the virus, and they didn't have a surefire way to know the virus was deactivated. Today's vaccines often don't even contain the entire virus, but just a part that triggers an immune response.  also raising someone with mental disabilities can be incredibly hard on families even today.	0

A quick look shows universal healthcare saves everyone money on average. Free market wouldn't because insurance would have to cover non insuranced people. So those drifters would skate by, but anyone with a brain would pay for them.  Bah hum bug, give me the cheaper.	None	Uh, no. Evidence is quite clear. Universal healthcare nations are cheaper. They can often dump huge baggage costs like insurance adjusters, administration staff for insurance, various overcharging since money is guaranteed to be paid (dont have to worry the guy insurance is bad, or not there).   Free market or as free market as you'd get, would be a mess, possibly more then even now. Insurance would still be the primary way to handle healthcare, but insurance would not be affordable to everyone and even those with it would be varied, that means huge admin staff to handle it all. That means bulking up prices. Then you need to handle the uninsured, which means billing the insured more. That costs money. Failure to do this last part means legal changes away from free market, so its there.  Then again libertarian free market is so pie in the sky you may as well have God handing out lollipop and bandaids.	0

Dont get me wrong, isnt this great news?  This only ends with a vaccine and/or herd immunity - wouldnt that fact that it kills and causes less complications than expected, and has probably gone through way more of the population than expected be amazing news?	From the article:  --Most likely, though, you won’t feel sick at all. When UCSF researchers tested people for SARS-CoV-2 in San Francisco’s Mission District, 53% of those infected never had any symptoms. “That’s much higher than expected,” says Monica Gandhi, MD, MPH, a UCSF professor of medicine with expertise in HIV. Surveys of outbreaks in nursing homes and prisons show similar or even higher numbers. “If we did a mass testing campaign on 300 million Americans right now, I think the rate of asymptomatic infection would be somewhere between 50% and 80% of cases." Gandhi says.--  I believe this. I think in the future, many people will discover they've already had it and didn't know but I in no way think anybody should count on it. Please wear a mask.	None	0

No biology processes evidence supports evolution. The fields of biology do not support or show they do. Saying they do is saying nothing if science is the mechanism for what is true.

I'm a second generation black immigrant. I think I can at least appeal to authority on this matter. While it's true that black immigrants seek residence in the US for economic reasons, they are more than well aware of race relations in the US.

Today, those ideas have made their way somewhat to the mainstream. Dennis Kucinich is now a pro-Trump Fox News guest. I wouldn't be surprised if Greenwald goes the same way. These types just strike me as having a base need to be the "hero of the revolution" and fighting some vague overlord power. For much of the past couple of decades, with Occupy Wall Street and such, they had one ideology. Now, they have no qualms about picking and choosing which stories rile them up in order to be with another partisan group with an even greater victim complex.	So what is Greenwald really upset about?

It's not *unexplainable*, but the great pyramid specifically actually has 8 sides,  which are said to only visible during the equinox, and it is alligned accurately to true north within a negligable margin of error.

ge8etrt	Are there ongoing attempts to produce macroevolution in the lab?	&gt;A dog evolving into a reptile would certainly be hard to refute.  Dogs and reptiles are on different branches of the evolutionary tree - the branches *never* join up.  You can never escape your evolutionary history.  What you're asking for is ridiculous, and is explicitly disallowed by Evolutionary Theory.  Might I recommend an evening perusing Wikipedia? You need a basic education on the subject.	> What do you consider macroevolution and what results would indicate that it has been accomplished?   I'm just a layman, so I can't give a good answer, but I'd guess it would have to be something well above the family level.  This is a bad example, because dogs and cats don't breed fast enough for the experiment I'm talking about, but a dog evolving into a cat, or even a bear, would probably not be enough to make a diehard creationist admit that the "kind" is different --- they all have four legs, fur, etc.   Maybe a different class?  A dog evolving into a reptile would certainly be hard to refute.	What do you consider macroevolution and what results would indicate that it has been accomplished?  As others have pointed out, macroevolution isn't a rigorously defined term and is more colloquial.  Creationists on the other hand frequently use the term, but without a clear testable definition; same goes for "kind".  How would we know if we've evolved a new "kind" in the lab?  We have plenty of examples of newly evolved characteristics and phenotypes, even the evolution of multicellularity.  So I would say that we have already crossed that finish line and have dramatic, irrefutable results.    Though if you're interested specifically in deep evolutionary distances, there are labs using directed evolution to evolve genes so they diverge to the same degree as genes shared between humans and mice.  In this way we can actually see how genes evolve and change over very large evolutionary distances (and, surprise surprise, genes are highly evolvable over these distances).	None	0

Don't recall it offhand, no time to look it up at present (working).  Pretty sure you're referring to the [LuriaDelbrck experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LuriaDelbrck_experiment).	The mutations really are random, they're just passed through the non-random filter of our environment.  Mutations are errors in the copying mechanism of DNA, there's no molecular mechanism to direct mutations towards particular chunks of DNA that I'm aware of.  But yeah, mutations that are beneficial (given the totality of the organism's situation) are more likely to be spread, whereas mutations that are detrimental are not.  Neutral mutations just tend to hang around, creating genetic diversity and the possibility that one of them may be beneficial in the future (like, if the environment changes).

I briefly dated a guy who agreed with everything I said and wanted me to make all the decisions. He didnt want to rock the boat in any way ever.

gh3kxfu	EXCLUSIVE: Rare Footage UNDER The Great Pyramid Of Giza! - Exploring Subterranean Chamber!	I'd say Göbekli Tepe is more mysterious. It's far older and the purpose and society behind it largely unknown.  Groups can book access to the subterranean chamber and there are quite a few videos that show it:  [Here a tour from Schoch in 2019 for example.](https://youtu.be/RHXDB_uMC4M?t=725) at 12:05 you can see him.	Submission statement:   The Great Pyramid of Giza is clearly the most mysterious site on Earth and may be the origin of the conspiracy theory. This post complies with the subject matter considering it is an unprecedented look into the subterranean chamber which is blocked off from the public. There is no video really like this one and it gives people an on the ground look at the theories surrounding the Great Pyramid.   I mean, how often do you get to investigate a conspiracy (especially one of the most mysterious) on the ground, at the site without being bothered by the government?  Thanks everyone!

You do know that people from different denominations and religions read their 'holy books' very different?

This about protecting Australia. The national interest. Advanced liberal democracies are expected to hold a similar  standard set of 'good guy' values.

giqw1rq	Why do conservatives act like Communist is going to take over the United States? When its Corporations that are gaining power?	True, proper communism actually shares something in common with proper democracy:  Both are governmentless systems completely operated by the people.	I think that people define it in different ways, which is why it's such a meaningless term.  Communism is when the GOVERNMENT/STATE/Workers run all areas of the private sector for the  "good" of the workers.  Also, notice how I put good in quotes before you call me a commie.  But the businesses in the United States are not run by the government. In fact, it's the businesses or corporations that typically dictate how the government should run.  &#x200B;  ETA:  The United States spent tons of money throughout the free world to fight Communis. So I doubt what we're experiencing Communism.	What do you think communism is?	>mmon with proper democracy:   >   >Both are governmentless systems completely operated by the people.

gjenbai	Trump planning payback for 10 Republicans who impeached him: report	Who is “one of the 10”- wtf are you talking about?	What's really crazy is I was listening to an interview with one of the 10 on NPR just a little bit ago and he let slip the word assassins in conjunction with talking about things that weren't being released. He tried to cover it up quick, but that slip makes me think maybe trump or someone in his scummy gang put a hit out on some people.

gjfjd4y	Pro-Choice/Pro-Life Question	i really don’t see an embryo’s potential or even a small fetus’ potential, any more significant than a lone sperm cell’s potential or the potential of a single human egg. They all have potential.  Oh, but the pregnant person’s potential however. That’s the potential I care about most.	Oh okay great explanation. So if u have an abortion, you wouldnt really feel bad that u will end what could become a baby? Like different emotions ig. Also when would the ZEF qualify as a baby? When it is born?	A fetus is a living being. Not a baby, and not nothing. Somewhere in between. A fetus is alive, but is incapable of emotions, pain, processing, is unconscious and unaware of their surroundings, and cannot survive outside of my body. The only relation a fetus has with a baby is that they are both of the same species. "My body my choice" applies here because the fetus is literally inside me, actively taking my energy and resources, and is completely unconscious. My body and my desires are much more important than the body of my fetus.	So u don’t think about what it will be in about a year correct? Thank you.	0

gjiv6vj	Need some advice!	How can I find out how much resistance is in this arrangement, and how much resistance should I be using to get the coil to travel through the coils?	It seems like you have a lot of resistance from the magnets, if you just put a bunch of coils in and let it run for a while. The magnets will lose some speed as they are moving through the coils, and they will have to accelerate to keep up with the magnets, which is a lot of extra potential energy. For the most part we want as close as possible to the actual load, and if we are trying to use a larger load, the larger the load, the more resistance is going to be.

gjj40wn	When youre running a normal TFO for the millionth time just for an endeavor & someone says "Noob Team"	If you have no rerolls left you've been wasting those tokens on Endeavors that you're probably doing wrong. What Endeavors do you reroll?	No it was a personal endeavor of completing x faction specific TFOs (no rerolls left), cant comment on the other teammates reasoning for being there.  As for the person in question his reasoning for "noob" was different & unrelated to it being an endeavor but thanks for sharing your thoughts.	I mean, that person isn't wrong, although the statement does apply to the entire team including themselves. Running a TFO just for an (I assume Universal) Endeavor box's likely reward of 50k EC and some R&D mats is - though popular - a noob move. Anyone who's taken a few minutes to figure this out will ignore most UEs instead of wasting their time.	Oh I have indeed wasted many tokens, purposely & by bad luck but the opinion of them being wasted is entirely subjective.  As is gaming itself where one persons fun is not anothers. We could & most probably do for instance differ in areas where we may outperform each other and thus make decisions accordingly.  That said efficiency doesnt equate fun for everyone all the time.

gjj8zaz	Arrest warrant issued for former Florida Dept. of Health analyst Rebekah Jones	Those same free speech advocates were silent after reports that republicans were terrified of speaking out against trump, afraid that the mob would target them personally.  Terrorism can censor speech. Twitter shutting down trumps account was shutting down an established channel for terrorist recruitment.  None of those fucking smoothbrains can explain why a data scientist isn’t allowed to blow the whistle on DeSantis’ crooked behavior, but trump should be allowed to publicly order the assassination of members of congress.	"The agent told my lawyer there would be only one charge, but emphasized that speaking out or going to the media may result in police "stacking" additional charges. All of this just to silence a critic of a governor who failed to do his job and got thousands killed as a result."  Where are all the "muh first amendment" conservatives now? This is *actually* a government agency punishing someone for their speech. Aaannnddd... crickets.	None	Free speech for me, censorship for thee.	0

Generally I only loot blue and better for salvage purposes, but *what a pain in the dickhole* it is to go through all the dropped items and pick out the ones worth salvaging.  How nice it'd be if you could know which item in the pile was worth extracting, without having to check every single one.	None	None	0

And then saying "Hey...let's just be friends huh?"	If I hear "unity" from another disingenuous Republican again, I'm gonna bust.  After four years of driving division, disunity, and finally sedition they are now sooo concerned with unity and moving on.  I know Republicans are incapable of shame, but shame on them.

gjn8ju6	When youre running a normal TFO for the millionth time just for an endeavor & someone says "Noob Team"	That's cool, but irrelevant to the thread. OP clearly stated that they're running the TFO "just for an Endeavor" - not for fun. In such a case, it isn't worthwhile to slog through it rather than using a token, and not having enough tokens (as in OP's case, stated in comments) is due to struggling with Endeavors.	I do them for fun, unless its a terrible one.	I mean, that person isn't wrong, although the statement does apply to the entire team including themselves. Running a TFO just for an (I assume Universal) Endeavor box's likely reward of 50k EC and some R&D mats is - though popular - a noob move. Anyone who's taken a few minutes to figure this out will ignore most UEs instead of wasting their time.	True enough, but more often if I am in a TFO for an endv its not on Normal difficulty... Only time I play normal is on newbie toons or when one of my friends queues us for it(he tends to favor choosing normal vs Adv for uni as he sats the queue fills quicker, though in my experience the queue fills just as quickly no matter which difficulty)  OP also stated that he has never seen more than 20 tokens(which are granted as a random drop from endv boxes) shite luck with RNG is probably the biggest factor there. Bad luck on the token drop rate, and bad luck with what endvs he gets.	0

gjqli9t	Which scenario is the most common when it comes to the reasons women divorce?	Here’s the thing: Most women arent hyper-sexual. Every time someone does a survey or statistic on sexual behavior, it’s always shown that women have less than five sexual partners.	Wow! That website has some startling statistics on how female sexual history impacts marriage:  > - Women who lost their virginity as a teenager are more than twice as likely to get divorced in the first 5 years of marriage than women who waited until age 18 or older.  > - Women with 6 or more premarital sexual partners are almost 3 times less likely to be in a stable marriage.  Female sexual history obviously plays a big role in the success of marriage.	Please actually look at the divorce/marriages statistics first:[Here's more statistics on Divorce!](https://www.wf-lawyers.com/divorce-statistics-and-facts/)  * Lack of commitment 73% * Argue too much 56% * Infidelity 55% * Married too young 46% * Unrealistic expectations 45% * Lack of equality in the relationship 44% * Lack of preparation for marriage 41% * [Domestic Violence](https://www.wf-lawyers.com/san-diego-domestic-violence-lawyer/) or Abuse 25%  (Respondents often cited more that one reason, therefore the percentages add up to much more than 100 percent)	I don't think that is accurate for the modern dating market.    I've seen it higher now.  Women who aren't high in socio-sexuality still have a high number of sex partners for two reasons: sexual experimentation is promoted today and is easily accessible, and they are trying to secure a relationship (having sex to be loved) in a market where they are competing with other women who are having sex earlier.  "Emcels", women who find it difficult to find an LTR and feel "emotionally celibate" often have a long string of sexual partners.	0

gjrnloc	What is the ideal length for an exclusive relationship	&gt;  But it's not unreasonable to expect to have sex at least weekly  And if things pop up like children-related problems, funeral, money problems, etc? Wife may not be horny if her child is dealing behavioral problems or worst, needing a life-saving surgery and recovery.	>If someone goes into a marriage expecting non-stop sex like they had in the beginning, he/she married for the wrong reasons.  I doubt anyone in marriage expects nonstop sex. But it's not unreasonable to expect to have sex at least weekly or more often to reaffirm mutual committment mainly. If you're expecting sex everytime you're horny then yeah okay you'll be disappointed. But most people don't expect that.	> if a man gets married and wants to have sex he is married for the wrong reasons.  No. The issue isn't expecting sex in marriage. It's putting sex as a high priority in marriage. For the vast majority of couples, the sex declines due to change in hormones, change in appearances, and more responsibilities especially when you have kids. If someone goes into a marriage expecting non-stop sex like they had in the beginning, he/she married for the wrong reasons.	It very much depends on the circumstances which is why I'm speaking in general terms.   If a child is dying then yes that's a major exception.  I'm talking about a normal relationship with or without normal well behaved children, in it's 5th-20th year, between two partners who profess to love eachother and don't have major relationship issues like infidelity or one of them getting very fat or abuse or anything.   If, at that point, sex dries up? Both people have legitimate gripes.   It's quite ironic actually how hard you're arguing for a woman to cold shoulder her man. I think you don't actually understand that some women face this problem as well. My mom divorced my dad primarily because my dad would rarely be intimate with her. I pray you never are in a relationship where you must experience what you're arguing to support.	0

Lots of distaste with Gladys in the comments recently and I've gotta ask are we happy or mad with Gladys over the Coronavirus, I personally hate the woman but I mean as someone from NSW I have nothing bad to say about her handling of this so far compared to other places. As far as I'm aware she has been doing something right, no?

dtguetm	Some disagreement with ol' des about sports and transes	And if a boy her age who had put in the same hours as her played her she would get wrecked.	10 years.  10 years in any given field, 10,000 hours, can make them a master of that field. In this regard, you are correct - my little sister is one of the best athletes I've ever met and can take on men twice her size on the soccer field and wreck them. She's been playing since she was 5 years old.  In this regard, there is a continuum of quality. I think Destiny was making a much more general point about biology without accounting for extraneous factors like having 10,000 hours of experience.	None	No, I'm saying she goes up against those guys, and she wrecks them.  The point being experience, mastery, can be an great equalizer, which is to the OP's point.  We can agree that things on average based on biology would be different. I'm supporting OP's point that those intrinsic differences can absolutely be overcome. They are outliers and require things like mastery but they're not set in stone.	0
dthmqdv	Where's the proof that Tonka Saw was doxxed by Destiny According to the Anti-SJW's?	Aren't the street addresses of Steven's houses being posted by Kiwi Farms also public info, hence how they got them?	Still not doxxing though, there are public interviews out there with pics of him.  These people are calling public info doxxing.	Pretty sure Destiny admitted he got the dox from someone and spread it further.	Of course, however I feel there is a big difference between posting that IMDB page, and posting destinys address and photos of his house.   The stuff on kiwifarms has people calling for destinys son to be murdered in front of him.  If you want to argue that these two things are the same, that is your right but I will not participate in that conversation.  The IMDB page that Destiny shared did not include an address.  There are pictures and video of Tonka made to promote his wrestling, one of the pics he is most angry about is literally from a wrestling journalism website.   I feel these are vastly different than people looking up country records to find out where Destiny lives in hopes of getting him hurt.  	0

I wouldn't mention obligatory gun ownership as a positive example. That is as much a violation of liberty as banning gun ownership. I also try to avoid arguing about statistics, because it's a utilitarian argument and they are generally pretty weak arguments. Statistics are pretty worthless and any number of principled arguments for gun ownership are way stronger.   One that I like is Malcolm X and the Black Panthers.

He has no concept of the value of money and a fool and his money are easily parted especially if he's giving away shares for a sandwich. Not even an entire sandwich either.	I think a lot of it is Charlie is the worst at money management of the group (although all but Frank are awful), and he seems to value money the least of the group.

e39i4m9	Episode Discussion – Legs From Here to Homeworld	Interesting! I think her "difference" comes down to something like being the first gem, the gem that creates the others, etc. 	In the subtractive colour model, magenta (pink), cyan (blue) and yellow combine to make black. This colour model is used in printers and its called subtractive because each colour subtracts wavelengths from white. Different amounts of each colour can make different colours. Because of this, I think that if Pink, Blue and Yellow fuse, theyll form Black Diamond, but it also makes me think that they are subtracted, or made out of White Diamond. Just my two cents.

e39iad8	Episode Discussion – Legs From Here to Homeworld	I think the diamonds ships are fundamentally different stuff than the run of the mill ships. Probably much more resource intensive to build, if not built out of stuff they can't find/afford anymore. 	I just realized something. Pink's ship was thousands of years old, yet made the journey from Earth to Homeworld in a few hours. Long enough for a nap after a long day at least.  Yet Lars hasn't reached Earth in all this time with a modern, top of the line ship.  I know a diamond's personal ship is probably the best at the time, but still, thousands of years of progress.  Perhaps Lars's ship can't travel directly otherwise they'd be intercepted. They have to sneak around in an indirect flight path. Still, even accounting for that, the difference between the time it takes seems strange.	None	None	0

ef4a0sw	What is your biggest nitpicks regarding a video game that you just can't get over?	No no no, I didn't complain about cool downs in combat. That is fine, it forces choices. Original Sin kept the cool downs out of combat though which was what was wrong. It didn't create any choices for the player or impact on the game but just forced to wait longer than nessecary to heal your party.	I don't mind cooldowns if the combat is complex. An old-school MMO with 15 bloated ability bars means there's always something to do, and cooldowns actually result in a management mechanic.  How the hell did MOBAs and all these MOBA-lite shooters and what-have-you catch on, though? You have 3-4 abilities with arbitrarily-long CDs. You use your 3-4 abilities to score a gank (because why balance abilities when you can just lump them with longer CDs), and then you... wait. You wait for the game to let you do anything other than hide in cover or spam basic attacks.	Lack of respect for a player's time. In any game. The one that is most prominent in my mind is Original Sin. The combat in that game is punishing so you will often need to heal up in between fights.  Your spells and abilities have cool downs so if you are using those to heal you are going to have spend a lot of time waiting for them to recharge. This is unforgivable. If I had to spend resources in the form of healing potions fine. Cool downs in combat, fine. Cool downs when the only thing that tests is my patience? Awful.   This is also why I prefer short games now. Too many games seem to just cram stuff in to waste your time. Upgrade systems and crafting for example. Unless your game is about crafting then it is wasting my time. 	None	0

Depends on the community, but generally no. Things like food, water and sleep schedule are usually part of the run. It's kinda the equivalent to an ultra-Marathon in that way.  Fun little anecdote: there was a famous 61-year old farmer (Cliff Young, look it up) here in Australia who won a major ultra-Marathon, running in boots and overalls against decorated athletes. He won because while everyone else was breaking for 6 hours sleep every day, he just didn't stop to sleep.

eku30ml	LAOP has been unlawfully imprisoned by their parents who suspect they are the victim of spiritual possession.	Unfortunately, it's not easy to acquire that type of housing.  It takes time for an opening to become available and an inpatient facility is not going to let a person chill there indefinitely after they're deemed stable, even if they have no place to go. I've been in an eerily similar situation to LAOP. I refused to go back to my parent's house because I was an adult and they were basically holding my hostage, so I got unwittingly got myself committed to a state hospital for telling the doctor if I were sent back, I would kill myself. That was definitely not the thing to say, but from there I was discharged into a residential living situation so I guess it worked out in the end. 🤦‍♀️	It's so unfortunate that inpatient psychiatric care has gotten such a bad rep that OP seems resigned to living as a prisoner based on the mere threat of being sent.      What exactly does OP think will happen at inpatient that isn't already occurring?  Confinement, check.  Forcing meds, check.  Unknown duration, check.  Isolation and ruining your life, check.       Literally the worst case scenario is already occurring and he's still terrified to go inpatient.  Just goooooo!

elprvlj	Howard with his real hair	&gt; You get the bald thing from your mother's side in that whole genetics thing.  Contrary to popular opinion, you do not inherit the genes responsible for hair loss exclusively from your mother's side of the family.

While the primary baldness gene is on the X chromosome, which men get only from their mothers, other factors are also in play.

em7qhw8	How to stand up to a bully	I second the advice for creating a paper trail out of police reports. The best thing for surviving a bully or stalker is to call in help and that means making sure there are records of the incidents and that these records are in the hands of the authorities.	Keep records of bullying incidents. Log details of the incident including time, date and witnesses.  &#x200B;  Report  it to the appropriate people in the school. If they don't do anything report it to the police. Again when you report things keep track of who you reported to and when. If you report it to the police get the officer's ID and the incident number.  &#x200B;  Also reporting incidents by e-mail can help create a paper trail.  &#x200B;  As for standing up to him you just do it. The bully might back down or they might step it up. If they get physical and you defend yourself at least you'll have a record of their campaign of harassment and the steps you have taken to stop it.  &#x200B;  If you're asking how to reliably defend yourself...

ezp394p	Fastest Stranger Mission Ever	Yes, if you were able to accept a mission as soon as you finish one. Since you have to travel to the next stranger, it means more downtime.  For example, by taking your time you'll do 2 maybe 3 missions in an hour, by rushing you won't do more than 5-6 due to traveling, and you wont be able to fish/hunt while waiting for that optimal 30sec windown.  There is an argument to be made that the optimal point is 15min, since the pay increase per minute drops slightly after that point, but a lot of the point above still apply to delivering the mission "halfway" into the allotted time.  Generally speaking, in gold the difference will be slight, and sometimes doing them quickly might even generated more nuggets than taking your time, but waiting for the 30 sec is more reliable, and generates more $$$ due to being able to hunt/fish while you wait.	I read somewhere that when you break it down, the rewards per minute are more the faster you go. For instance, doing stranger missions efficiently for an hour yields more rewards than doing them slowly for an hour. In that sense its a bit of a consolation prize. Ive never tested this out myself though.	Payouts for missions should be judged on how quickly and how efficiently they're done. Not how closely you can get to the end of the timer.	None	0

fabue4u	Fallen asleep. Melbourne, 2016.	Hi fellow Melburnian!  Uhhhhm, I would say the reason for the green tint is fluorescent lighting and Lomography film.   Fluoro light tends to go green on film in general anyway, but Lomo film especially takes on a colour "cast" from the most prominent light sources in frame.	Hey Melbourne Central :)  Was there a reason for the strong green tint here?	None	Ah, shooting film. That explains everything.	0

fby223f	Mississippi Valley State player tells student section "I'll kill you."	Perhaps should have said not a credible immediate threat. Kid was not armed, likelihood of having a weapon he could access at that moment or in the hours afterward are slim to none and odds of him coming back to find the kid when he is heading out of town right after the damn game, highly unlikely. But glad we could have this civil chat.	Who the fuck are you to say it's not a credible threat...	Group of dumb kids say dumb things. Another dumb kid loses his cool and says something even worse that is — most importantly — in no way a credible threat, so chill the eff out. The player needs to be dealt with, and should likely face suspension or maybe even expulsion, but all the pearl clutching from the student section should maybe lead to more self-reflection than finger pointing: Act like a dick and dick things happen. And no, parsing it into the form of student section hijinx makes it no more acceptable. Act like a bunch of dicks, get treated like a bunch of dicks.	I mean is anyone saying that he was going to actually kill them? I don’t think so. But if you make a death threat, you have to be dealt with in some way, such as suspension or expulsion as you said. I don’t think anybody is overreacting more than that	0
fc1y86k	[Post Game Thread] Houston defeats #23 Washington 75-71	Yes. Nice win for Houston. Cougars made UW look damn bad on offense for the last 25 minutes of the game. And the idea that Washington is going to the NIT is silly. 5-9 is their seed range.	Good win. It feels nice beating a good team like Washington when we havent really done that this year.	None	Washington is ranked 69 in rpi. After this loss, they will be around the 90s. You're right, they might not even make it to the NIT. Houston really broke Washington, you can see it in the players. There is a great chance that Mcdaniels and Stewart may not play for Washington anymore to prepare for the draft. After this draft, Hopkins is also on the hot seat and he won't last long at Washington. His past few seasons at Washington has been terrible.	0

fcl6q18	Basic statics sanity check	As modeled I don't believe the legs are overkill. My question was more pertaining to whether I've modeled the load realistically than whether the pipe can handle what is shown. Apologies for the confusion there.   Thank you for reminding me about the axial stress, I gave myself a good facepalm for that one. Luckily, it's small enough to be almost negligible (~0.3 ksi). I'll have to dig into chapter H more, but on first glance it appears I'm good for axial.	If the stresses in the legs are just shy of 20 ksi, I can hardly see how you would call them "overkill". Also, you need to check the legs in axial loading and use Chapter E of AISC to determine the allowable strength. Use Chapter H for combined bending and axial.	None	You may want to add some mid level braces depending on how long the legs are. Check kl/r, so you can develop the full compressive strength of the legs.	0
fcl72jz	Basic statics sanity check	I replied to raoulduke, but the 20ksi is bending stress. I forgot to check axial, but that stress is very small (0.3 ksi). My question was more in regards to whether I have the load from the vessel onto the frame modeled correctly than whether the pipe as currently sized can handle the situation shown. Sizing is very preliminary at this point.	20 ksi just from axial load not including bending/eccentricity? Second what raoulduke25 said.	None	None	0

But if it's against white people or feminists doing it, then its 👌 by reddit.	a majority of subs that are posted here are antisemetic hate-mongering subs that reddit does not want to platform. It is fully within its rights to not platform a bunch of hateful dipshits who only wish to sew discord and not actually have meaningful conversations, because they are closed off from actual facts.	This isn’t really a political sub at all, it’s just that a large majority of subs that get banned are right-leaning because Reddit is a left-leaning website. As a result, a majority of subs posted on here are political.	None	0

Like something he took his time on? I can't read the manuscript well at all, assumed he just had bad have writing lol	Ive never tried it myself, but Ive heard from people who have copied out the Book by hand. Apparently, its a struggle to get each chapter done in an hour. You have to write very quickly.  Of course, that doesnt prove Crowley actually took only an hour to write each chapter, but his handwriting is pretty bad in the MS, even for him.  Los, 8=3	None	Unfortunately, a quick google turns up writing samples that are just atrocious, worse than I remembered.  The man just had bad handwriting.

ffd8h7e	(Discussion) What do you think about Anton Lavey?	He literally kept a lion in his yard which he would physically abuse. He would even use an electric cattle prod. He used it on his dog too. Zeena once shared a story of him "savagely beating the dog" in old age.	Knew he was a douche to people but didn't know he hurt animals. I always had the impression of him as a big animal lover. What did he do to abuse animals?	He's whatever. An interesting character to be sure but more a blip on my radar at this point. Most of his work is unoriginal and taken from others without credit, historically inaccurate, philosophically contradictory, etc. He played his role in Revitalization of the LHP in the modern West but that's about it. Also not a fan about lying about yourself to improve your validity or whatever.  He was also an animal, wife, and child abuser which I just have a serious bias against.

The oral blisters are due to breathing in radiation and having it concentrate around the mouth.	From what I've read, this is a picture of one of the firemen who survived (name is unknown, and be warned that the photo contains nudity): [https://images2.imgbox.com/d3/50/6fB9S57k\_o.jpeg](https://images2.imgbox.com/d3/50/6fB9S57k_o.jpeg)  He required something like 200 reconstructive surgeries and lived into the 2000s.

fj40nn3	Fire fighter photos	I just discovered that the second guy Palamarchuk is referencing in the video is Anatoly Baranov, who wasn't a fireman per se, but an electrician who helped to put out the fires in the turbogenerator hall. Since the article where I found that photo describes the patient as a fireman, I would expect it to be someone from the Pripyat fire department, but you never know.  By the way, it's astonishing Palamarchuk is still alive. His effective radiation dose was estimated at 8-9 Gy, which is the highest I've ever heard of anyone surviving. According to Richard Mould's book, he became infertile though.	The second image should be Kibenok or Baranov.

fmt3ds9	Loss of smell and taste in combination with other symptoms is a strong predictor of COVID-19 infection	Yesterday I lost taste and was convinced I contracted it.  It was so weird, went to eat my breakfast, and toast tasted like nothing, like I was eating cardboard.    Turned out to be an ear infection, which I had never known can have that side effect (great timing to throw me that fucking curve ball).  So people out there, there’s a myriad of reasons you can lose taste and/or smell, so don’t jump to panic if this happens to you!	Personally and anecdotally I had total loss of smell but not (total) loss of taste. Some things, but not everything just tasted mildly different. I don't think you would necessarily have both at the same time. At the same time, I also never had the thing where you pinch your nose and not taste stuff anymore, it didn't work	Someone posted an article of an pulmonologist who survived covid-19 and he said that he too suffered from loss of taste but not the loss of smell and he didn’t belive that the virus attacked the cranial nerve V but instead was rather linked to a mouth fungus due to an immunsupression caused by the virus. I found this information interesting.	I also had and still have (after like 12-14 days) a lot of shortness of breath, don't think ear infection causes that	0

fmtgbca	Total confirmed cases vs. Total confirmed deaths from COVID-19	Because the number of deaths in no way correlates to the number of caskets and urns shipped to that area of the world.	Why? They locked down Hubei for over a month. I'm pretty sure the number of infections in countries like Italy and Spain (real numbers -- not the reported numbers) are way down by now as well, since they've been locked down for almost a month.	Gosh it’s really amazing how China’s numbers went down so fast	The number of urns shopped in that part of the world *also* suggests the number of infections has gone way down, just less than the official reported numbers would suggest. Deaths are much higher than reported in Italy and Spain as well, but we still have every reason to believe that the number of infections are going down, because of the lockdowns. Would it be "amazing" for that to eventually be reflected in official numbers?	0

g1f4x03	Troy is pretty great, but ...	That’s not true, I remember the soldiers would shout “totsugeki!” which google translate tells me means “assault”.  Maybe there another phrase that the soldiers yelled when attacking that I forgot about?	I see they have never learned.  In shogun 2 your troops yell "RETREAT" in japanese when you charge with them into the enemy.	None	I always thought it was "tusgete" which o think means "help"	0
g2c0nn0	Netflix Apologized for its Upcoming Movie "Cuties" Inappropriate Poster Sexualizing Children	I feel like there’s a lot of judgement before anyone’s seen it. Little Miss Sunshine is technically about the same premise and there’s a scene that is pretty explicit in that. I still think it’s a really good movie with a great message, but can you imagine if they used that scene as the poster of the movie? I guarantee people would be up in arms saying what they are saying here.  EDIT: [Here’s a link to the trailer](https://youtu.be/M0O7lLe4SmA)	They should just cancel it.	None	Pretty sure Little Miss sunshine was calling out the sickness that existed in those environments. The grandfather obviously was all like, ‘OK you want little girls to behave this way then I’m not going to make it undertones of creepy I’m going to make it outright fucking creepy’.	0
g2xf2hz	Utilizing ECS and DOTS, now on Kickstarter!	Thank you so much! Is your project similar in that it is top down, or that you're using ECS/DOTS, or both?	I'm making a personal project similar to this to learn Unity. I'm definitely going to back this and closely follow the development! Top downs are my favorite, I love seeing more. Awesome work!	None	Top down Squad-like, looking at using ECS/DOTS as multiplayer on PUN peer 2 peer would suffer if not.  Truth be told I'm not very experienced in game dev - i come from boring healthcare industry database and front end design/development, but I am staging this out/researching as if I were building something for work.  ECS/DOTS is very interesting to me - i dont expect to ever ship anything so being able to just play with stuff/make stuff that I want is very refreshing, as I am so used to building based on rigid requirements.	0

g3m5qtk	Wow, I have no words. It really is a cult	&gt; I know they're aren't any  Why do you know that? The line belies, no, literally admits to the historical truth that Yahweh was only one god in a pantheon of local gods at that time. As you say, it's right there in the text. What made Moses' pitch unique and noteworthy was that it was the beginning of the push for his tribe to venerate one of those gods in particular, *more* than all other gods that were indeed understood to exist, rather like a tutelary deity. It was only much later that Yahweh began to subsume the roles of those other gods in the minds of that tribe, until eventually he had taken on (or abandoned) all of their aspects and became understood to be the only *true* god, relegating all remaining supernatural entities (of which there were still many) to lower ranks of divinity.	Very first commandment: thou shall have no other gods before me.     Which is interesting, because it acknowledges that there are other gods.     I mean,  I know they're aren't any.   But within the framework of Christianity, people tend to ignore this.	None	I'll explain how I know, after you define what a god is.   I have different arguments depending on what your definition of a god is.	0
g3m9e2d	CERN is satanic	As it happens, Apollo *was* believed by the Greeks to visit the land of the Hyperboreans, those who lived beyond/above the North Wind, once every four years or something. But that was a mythical place, and was usually described as an island or peninsula. Some have tried to connect that myth to Britain or have placed it in the North Sea, even in antiquity, but I've never heard anyone connect it to Switzerland.   Furthermore, I've never heard of any Temple of Apollo in Switzerland before. A rudimentary Googling doesn't return any results for any such site, either—in fact, the only thing I'm seeing is a few WordPress blogs talking about CERN being located on the site of an ancient oracle dedicated to the god. While Apollo was certainly a god of such things (the Oracle at Delphi was devoted to him, after all), if there were such an oracular site so far north, I feel as though it wouldn't be something only vaguely referred to in blogs, but would hit at least *one* semi-scholarly source.  So yeah, this just has "internet urban legend" bullshit written all over it.	> located on an ancient Apollo/Nimrod worship site  1) I think you are equating a Greek deity with a biblical person, which is not true.  2) Although I may be wrong on this, but there were no Apollo worship sites anywhere near Switzerland.  3) Also, if Nimrod is so bad, why would he be worshipped? Answer: he wasn't AFAIK.  > They have a statue of Shiva the destroyer coming from a portal outside their building  No idea if it's really there, but even if, what's so wrong about it?   > 666 in their logo  I could make the same argument for your name.

g76607o	What would you say are Federation society's biggest flaws?	The way I think of the economy of Star Trek is trying to imagine that I'm trying to explain today's economy to someone from the year 1620. It wouldn't make a lot of sense to them. We're certain to have very different economics in the 25th century, but what they will be, I can't know.	I have a counterpoint to all of the "money" things you guys are saying: A lot of Star Trek's economics is post-scarcity Communism.   In the federation, consumer goods are manufactured by the replicator. All basic needs and some advanced ones are provided to everyone because there is enough for everyone. For things that can't be replicated, there is no money, but that doesn't mean there's no currency. Latinum isn't money, it's currency. For instance, we see it used as currency on DS9 and occasionally in TNG. When people are seen buying things on TNG or DS9 they are probably using latinum. Starfleet officers are probably given some stipend when on exploratory missions or living on stations in foreign space (like DS9) so that they can participate in the economy of the area.  While some people (notably Joseph Sisko) work to fulfill their passion for a craft, it's entirely likely that people are paid some amount just for working in order to encourage people to do something.

g766d45	What would you say are Federation society's biggest flaws?	The Federation thinks that the genetic engineering leads to something like Khan, but Khan was both raised and bred to feel superior.	Its treatment of AI and the genetically engineered.   Both Data and the Doctor had to fight for the rights of personhood. From both a legal and social perspective. Holograms in general have gotten the short stick. As they are regarded as literal tools, even when they develop true sentience.  The starfleet ban on genetic engineering is also problematic. Personally I don't think the argument for the ban holds water. Yes argumentation did lead to Khan but that is not the only outcome.	None	None	0
g79ldtp	As usual, sequels miss the whole point fo iconic scenes	What about them is brilliant? A bookend like that (where something from the beginning of a story is referenced at its end) is a very standard tool in storytelling. It's a very easy visual design choice to come to and some star wars comics have done so already for years. This movie didn't set his death up well at all in any thematic or logical way, (many fans were unsure why he was dying at all, and even the director admitted the choice was done near the very end of production editing) so why would the simple visual being there make it brilliant?	The sequels were meh but Lukes death and the twin suns were brilliant.	None	None	0

If all of that sounds correct, then my questions to you would be, what do you expect your teacher to do? Are you hoping they will repeat their previous lectures for you? Also, very specifically, what "help" did you ask of your teacher? And what was their response?	It more that I skipped a lot of pre algebra now they are asking me a lot of things I dont understand and my teacher refuses to help me	I don't understand whats your question  and yes 4x + 3 = 19  x is equals to 4	When I first started the algebra, I couldn’t understand a lot of it either, I asked her to clarify and  give barely any help and oesnt try to see what I did wrong, I send her multiple emails try to see what I should try to do and never responds, now my dad is angry at me for getting a 75 instead of 90’s. I neglected her after she didn’t respond, here just giving the name of what we were learning that day would’ve helped, I could just go to khan academy videos and find out because I find them way more helpful than my teacher explaining it to me	0

An original worm fic, emphasis on the supernatural horror. One of my favourite stories.  There's also [Aeon Entelechy Evangelion](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/aeon-entelechy-evangelion-ane-rewrite.1327/), an Evangelion fic by the same author. Evangelion already had some strong cosmic horror vibes going on, but this goes all in by crossing over with the Cthulutech universe.	Does anyone know of any good Lovecraftian/cosmic horror stories? Preferably books/web serials, but anything is fine.   I've already read most of [Katalepsis](https://katalepsis.net/), all of the [I Was a Teenage Necromancer](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23635/i-was-a-teenage-necromancer) series, and Lovecraft's stuff.  I'm sure there is more out there, especially in published works, but I'm not sure what's good.	It's been a while but from memory, not much at all. From Evangelion, Mechs are a thing and the enemies are aliens/robots/alien-robots. From the Cthulutech side of things, people live in arcologies, self contained population centers and the government is not very ethical at all.  Actually having written that out makes me realise just how similar both NGE and Cthulutech are. Alien existences intrude on earth and the primary bastion of humanity are semi-isolated regions ran by governments that don't know the definition of inalienable rights.  Anyways, NGE is 26 episodes each 22 minutes long. If you have time, are into contemplative mindfuckery, love subtext and have the stomach for depressive overtones, go for it.	0

gaow3qo	So if the Christian God does without a doubt exist he thought Adam and Eve would be the best representation of all mankind and yet it failed.	Adam and Eve did not feel an inclination to sin. They were tempted by Satan, but Adam and Eve were weak, because they had not yet walked long enough with God to grow in wisdom and understanding to resist the schemes of the devil.	This certainly is a thought provoking question.   The most common answer to the problem would be that Adam and Eve truely did have a decision in choosing to rebel or not. God being all-knowing doesnt mean that he predestines everything. But he thought creating free humans was worth the cost it would entail.   At least thats the way the standard answer goes.   The harder question in my opinion, is Did Adam and Eve feel more so inclined to choose sin? Or Why were Adam and Eve created with an inclination towards sin? Ive thought about these sorts of questions for a long time, and I feel that the answer requires climbing down a rabbit hole of theology, so Ill resist that for now.	None	None	0

I think it's awesome that reddit exists today, so that we can ask questions like this to find out what a normal frame of reference should be.	I like that approach of gradually introducing responsibilities	Yes. They are supposed to make you food. They should have at least taught you how to make something better than a cheese sandwich. I think kids should start learning to cook at 12 and start making their own meals at 15, but the parents should still make dinner for the family if they have time.

gcm04hk	Benchmarking on rpiZero vs much more powerful stuff....	The title of this post led me to believe you actually wanted to benchmark pi-hole. This benchmark, as I'm running it, simulates a burst of queries to pi-hole. You can play with the benchmark's options to simulate various bursts of queries. As noted in my other comments, this is a real world scenario, on a HOME NETWORK, because that's where I found the problem. Since you have plex and a NAS, I suspect (but could be wrong) that you are using one of the services that is affected by this.  I don't get the head in the sand attitude on this sub when someone points out something slightly negative of pi-hole.	So if I'm reading the documentation right, this script will just hammer the pi-hole w/ queries as fast as the CPU (single thread) can generate them.   That's not even remotely close to my use case.   &#x200B;  Like, if I'm running in a large corporate environment? I'm not using a pi-zero.

gdmolkt	For those who use Jean: How is she for you?	thats 1-2s of holding, 3-4s for them to fall down, fall damage is helpful when your team isn't geared in higher level abyss but falls off because you're missing out on 4-6s of dps time and 3-4s viridescent venerer uptime	I don't think her E is much of an issue. If the target is small enough to be launched that far, then you're probably better off holding E and launching them for fall damage. If they're too large to be launched into the air, then a tap E is incredibly useful for staggering them mid attack or while they're trying to get shields up.	depressing without venti, she fits into every team as a 2 in 1 healer/anemo user though  her e is very antisynergy being that it knocks people away forcing you to dash twice to catch up to other people, but since you have venti and can use them in tandem shes the best, as venti fixes the antisynergy problem with the suck and both feed each others ults	3-4s for fall damage is a bit of a stretch, realistically it's more like 1-2s. Thinking about this some more, it seems like it depends on your sets and characters. I always run her with noblesse along with venti so the only reasons to use her E are either to gather energy during a venti tornado (or for fall damage when the situation is fitting). But, I can see how someone using her as their sole VV swirler can have problems with her E.	0

gef7g71	Weekly Question and Answer Thread - 29 November, 2020	It isn't any more or less difficult, just different. That's why seasoned players will say it's harder, but it isn't really, just a new learning curve.   I actually didn't like SFO at first but I kept playing and the longer I played the more enjoyable I realized it was. When you play vanilla WH2 the first thing you'll notice is that the early game is literally the most fun part about the campaign, yet it is also the fastest part of the game. The biggest thing SFO does is make the early game last a little longer by making factions and player not balloon into death balls by turn 30.   Also super badass characters actually feel super badass. I'm a fan of feel and aesthetic and SFO focuses more so on that.	how much more difficult is SFO Grimhammer 2 compared to the base game?

For as much as I dug Force Awakens, the destruction of Hosnian Prime and the surrounding planets was one of the undersold moments of the movie that the books really help deliver.  The Starkiller Base attack on the Hosnian system was a genocide the scale of which it's hard to wrap your head around.  In the film we had no frame of reference for who those people were and the sequence happens relatively quickly.  In the books it's referred to as the Hosnian Cataclysm and it was a scar on the minds of people around the galaxy.  I dug that they put the planet in Squadrons.	None	None	0

gfsiejw	If Numbers Don't Lie, then Ethereum 2.0 takes the Decentralization Crown (Audio)	That’s correct. In fact full nodes (in Eth sense) are able to reconstruct an archival node with several terrabytes of data without another archival node, just using the full node’s data.  However, if full independent verification of transactions is what we are looking for, we have to  consider full SPV bitcoin nodes too. Because such wallets can even run on phones, the number of such wallets is even higher than bitcoin full nodes.  Thus, catching up is even more unlikely still.	Pragmatically speaking, there is no difference between archival nodes and full nodes when it comes to a fully verified network that has 100% uptime and means to keep it that way. Archival nodes are important if the network goes down, but they are no better than pruned nodes in keeping 100% uptime in a decentralized fashion. Is there any argument against this?	Important to note that bitnodes is not listing all the bitcoin full nodes. The actual number is around 100K.  Also, what Eth calls a full node is a lower standard compared to a Bitcoin full node.  An Eth full node is equivalent to a Bitcoin pruned node. A Bitcoin full node is equivalent to an Eth archival node.  And there are only a handful Eth archival nodes left.  If we compare apples to apples, Bitcoin has several magnitudes more true full nodes (archival nodes). Since the Eth blockchain grows much faster than the Bitcoin one there is little chance Eth will be able to catch up with Bitcoin on this metric.   Sure there are many metrics, but on this specific issue the video is plain wrong.	None	0

The 15% in the other hotfix was changed to 20% here. Unholy is nuts right now and absolutely deserves some light nerfing. They're still going to be on top of the meters.

gg17oeb	Randomly clasped my hands in a Mundra while reading about Zen?	Blocks of the awakening process can manifest in *many* different ways. The blocks won't stay because the more it (you) fights that, the more it will manifest (usually).  One of the hazards of a premature awakening is that it can and often will bring up issues you haven't dealt with and if you haven't developed the mental, spiritual, and psychological tools to deal with those those issues when they resurface, it can cause what could be called "destructive" incidents to accommodate the dealing with that issue. Of course, "destructive" is just another way of saying "deconstruction." However, deconstruction could happen without regard for your physical needs. For example, you might lose your job and your job is what's paying for your house and this could happen because you're losing sleep, are in pain, thinking you're going crazy, and so on. Maybe you suddenly realize that there's a lot of toxic happenings at work or your friends and family are suddenly to inauthentic for you and if you haven't developed the tools to deal with that, you can lose or separate from those people, sometimes in ways that burn bridges that can't be rebuilt.   Chakras are merely places where the lines of energy (nadis, IIRC), meet. So if you're feeling something in that chakra, it's likely a symptom of something related to those specific areas of the body and/or psychology.	I have a question! It is my understanding that kundalini can manifest as pain on areas that represent the chakras? I have headaches often and my Google search says that the Mundra I did is tied to the crown chakra, which I understand is in the head?   Also, what is wrong with kundalini being awakened prematurely?	[This might be a great place to start reading](https://www.reddit.com/r/kundalini/comments/3fbyvv/spontaneous_mudras/). The situation isn't identical but the comments might answer questions. Or raise more, which is always good.	Ohhh I see, thank you for the great response!  I think I had something like what you described happen in my life. I've felt at times that I lost people and things, which lead me to self reflection and overall I felt the pain made me better.	0

gg8mrty	Roth IRA Advice needed, please.	I am not sure that is accurate.  I know married couples that were previously divorced, who file separately because they dont want ex spouses to see new spouses income at child support hearings.  I think any married couple who wants to is allowed to file separately.	You cannot file as married filing separately as you cohabited with your wife during the year (it doesnt matter whether she stayed without you or you stayed with her, and it doesnt matter whether the stay was at a hotel on vacation).  Thats the first thing.  Then theres the fact that married filing separately is generally the most disadvantageous to the taxpayer.  May I suggest you find an AARP Tax-Aide site during tax season (February 1 - April 15) and get your taxes done by an IRS-certified volunteer (like me) for free ?  Look it up online starting in mid-January.  Itll all be done remotely.	None	You are correct!  I rechecked the IRC and couples that live together can indeed file “married filing separately.”    A good tax preparer would probably want to talk to you about your future plans (to live together, or not, and where) and look into your exact incomes and expenses to figure out which filing status would be most advantageous to you.  Because MFS is generally the most disadvantageous to the taxpayer.	0

ghnt96h	How is God killing David's infant son for his affair compatible with the pro-life view?	&gt; If abortions are legal, then it's not murder.  Anti-abortionists don't argue the legality of abortion, but the morality of it. When anti-abortionists say, "Abortion is murder," they do not mean, "Abortion is unlawful killing," they mean, "Abortion is immoral killing."  Abortion's legal status is not under debate: everyone on both sides agrees it is legal (in the US and many other countries). Arguing the meaning of the word "murder" has no relevance to the actual issue, which is the morality of abortion, not its legality.  &gt; The intention of an abortion isn't to kill a fetus  If a man kills his ex-wife, he can't justify his actions by saying, "My intention wasn't to kill my ex-wife, but to avoid having to pay alimony to her. Sure, she died as a result, but that's not the point of it."	To murder is per definition an unlawful killing. If abortions are legal, then it's not murder.  And the intention of an abortion isn't to kill a fetus, but to avoid a full-term pregnancy and birth. Sure, the fetus dies as a result, but that's not the point of it.	How is it not?  We are commanded to not murder.  God killing people is not even homicide, much less murder.	Happy New Year!  > Anti-abortionists don't argue the legality of abortion, but the morality of it.  If only that were the case, then it wouldn't be such a hot political topic.   > everyone on both sides agrees it is legal  But a significant amount of people don't agree that it should be.  > If a man kills his ex-wife, he can't justify his actions by saying, "My intention wasn't to kill my ex-wife, but to avoid having to pay alimony to her. Sure, she died as a result, but that's not the point of it."  No, but if you're stealing food from my fridge everyday as your only way to prevent you from starving, and I put a lock on the fridge to protect my food from getting stolen, and you die as a result, then I can justify my action by saying "My intention wasn't to kill stanleyford, but to protect my food from being taken against my will."	0

gi5j7yh	Traffic Flow Calculation	I would emphasize that this conversion makes sense when comparing traffic levels against capacity of a road.   However, this conversion does not make much sense when speaking of pedestrians, unless they competed for road capacity with cars.  From what I can gather, the objective here is to estimate the total flow of passengers on a spot, to then try to use it to predict something else. In that case, you should weight every type of vehicle by its average occupancy to get an estimation of passenger flow.	Some models that transport planners use, eg SATURN, apply a 'passenger car unit' to different types of vehicles.

However, updates have added complexity that makes it extremely difficult and time consuming to “figure it out”.

I wish I had your professor!  My Discrete Math professor just told me to kill myself because I was getting questions wrong on his tests.  I dropped all my classes and gave up on being a programmer.	Discrete math is the reason I shouldn’t have my CS degree. I had no idea what was going on in that class. I resigned myself to the fact I’d failed the class and quit going.  I’d see the prof ever day smoking outside and he’d wave.  Every so often he would say “Hey we are having a test next time, please come!”  So I’d go and fail his test.  The day of the final, there are only a handful of us left. He tells us that we cannot leave until everyone has turned in their test.   When the last person handed in their test, he thanked us for sticking with him through his first semester of teaching in America.  He knew that he could improve on some things and his English wasn’t the best.  Everyone got at least a C.  That was the second happiest C of my college career.	None	0

giqtk6x	Dee Snider speaking against censorship and the PMRC before the U.S. Senate, 1985	Because:  1. She didn't incite violence. She portrayed it as part of a very bad joke that was in poor taste.  2. She didn't continually do it for 4 years.  3. She got fired from her job, which is actually worse than getting a Twitter ban.  4. Nobody got hurt/killed as a result of her Tweet.	So why does Kathy Griffin still have an account after taking a picture with a severed Trump head? What happened to concerns over inciting violence then?	I agree with what Dee says. But the timing of this post makes me think someone wants to associate what happened to Trump getting deplatformed in the last day or two as "censorship", which 1) it was well deserved as Trump was inciting violence, and 2) it's not a freedom of speech issue in the first place. If anything, what Trump has done is asked people to take away our votes and make them null because he is not happy with the outcome.	Go ahead and tell me if Trump posted a photo of him holding a fake severed head of Pelosi as a joke it would be described as a "very bad joke that was in poor taste" by literally anyone much less major political figures and new organizations. Tell me how they would deny it was inciting any form of violence because he would say it was "Just a joke". Go ahead and tell me any social media account he has ever held would still be up post 24 hours.  Go ahead, front center stage, say it.	0
girdz7r	Interesting Exchange	Which is 3 seconds that she may not have while she's at work. It sounds like she was kinda interested (though probably not super interested, but at least a little), and the texting is what put her off. You're talking about 3 texts in 5-6 hours, but if those 5-6 hours occurred while she was at work or caring for a sick family member, or helping a kid with virtual schooling... You get my point. You waited such a short time before coming to the conclusion that she wasn't interested, and I'm not even convinced that she wasn't until those texts happened. Not that she handled it well, but yeah, if someone texted me like that after one date, that would turn into a no from me really fast.	I respect and understand what you're saying and please  know I'm saying this in the kindest way possible. But that's the problem. Ya she doesn't owe me anything but just to be considerate. I was flat out just asking for confirmation that's all. Takes 3 seconds to say something.	This kinda sounds harsh... but just being honest. It’s not her job to give you closure. Yeah, she could, but you aren’t in a relationship with this girl.  She doesn’t owe you an explanation. She doesn’t owe you anything. Maybe your asking for her to respond with what you wanted or needed to move on seemed like entitlement.  Your expectations and desires can’t dictate her behavior.	None	0
girfz3h	Do you adress your parents by "usted", "tú" or "vos"	There's nothing wrong or disrespectful about vosotros, but it's literally only used in Spain, so there's no real point in learning it unless you're actually going to Spain and planning to live there long enough to make friends. I've always translated vosotros like "y'all" - plural you, but informal. That said, I've never heard anyone use it in real life, and I don't think I could conjugate it in a real-time conversation if my life depended on it.  If you're going to spend time in a Latam country, it's a good idea to learn what level of formality is appropriate for that area, but tbh, most people will be excited enough to hear a yanqui speaking Spanish that they won't take any offense if you don't use usted when you should or whatever.	As an English speaker (American) learning Spanish, why do we just skip over vosotros and all related conjugations? Is it just not common/acceptable? From what I gather it's like 'you all' but I'm not sure that's correct. How do you use vosotros?	None	None	0

For over five years after getting my braces off, I couldn't chew gum because it made my jaw ache.

giufo3c	Why do socialists blame actions of the police on capitalism?	That's the core problem; anything undesirable is attributed to Capitalism, while the faults of Leftism are entirely disowned on the premise that "true" Socialism or Communism would result in a perfect utopia and any issue must be down to the tendrils of Capitalism. They can't acknowledge that every system has pros and cons.  Like the way many Christians blame everything bad on "The Devil" even though in the Bible straight up says "I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord do all these things."  Nuance &amp; moral complexity are unwelcome guests for most humans.	Socialists will blame everything on capitalism. Everything.	None	None	0

Yes, it has been proven.	Has this been proven? All I've seen is a small force of police get beaten back by thousands.	After 1/6 I have to assume law enforcement, the national guard, and state governments are going to take these guys seriously and show up prepared with overwhelming force.  But then again some officers in the Capitol Police were complicit and opened the doors to the rioters...all it takes is a few cops who are sympathetic to the far-right (and there are plenty of them) for the situation to go to shit.	Are you talking about the barrier? According to the guy who filmed the video:  Footage captured by Marcus DiPaola, a freelance journalist working at TikTok, has been viewed more than 30 million times on Twitter and more than 1.7 million times on TikTok.  Many who have shared the clip have suggested it shows police letting people get close to the building. One Twitter post that featured the clip alongside the caption: "the police opened the f***ing gates" has been shared more than 200,000 times.  However, officers only backed away after being threatened while being vastly outnumbered, DiPaola said;  "They definitely didn't just open the barriers, the pro-Trump rioters made a fist like they were going to punch the cops, which is why I started recording, then they backed off the barricades," he told Newsweek in an email when asked for extra context to the clip.  Completely outnumbered, there wouldn't have been any point in fighting. The rioters moved up the steps of the capitol pretty quickly, capitol police tried to hold them back but they didn't have riot shields and really got pushed around."  https://www.newsweek.com/capitol-police-didnt-open-gates-rioters-viral-video-1559728	0

giyhw0c	In light of the last weeks events and the projected events of the next few weeks, it is worth revisiting the podcast "It Could Happen Here."	People are too comfortable for war. At the end of the day most Americans aren't ready to trade a climate controlled residence with high speed internet and convenience food for a jail cell or a bullet through the head. Of course they fold. They want to smoke weed and have a few beers later, not be in jail until their arraignment and maybe get fired.  To be clear, this isn't a bad thing. In a stable society, people will prefer their homes to warfare in the streets.	Interestingly enough his theoretical inciting incident (someone gets shot at a protest, it isnt immediately clear why, people get mad and blame partisan politics) has happened multiple times in 2020 and just recently at the capitol riot.   Id argue the main reason we havent seen more outright violence is theres no group that really wants it yet. Antifa likes to posture about bashing the fash but fold like paper the moment people start hitting back. The Proud Boys are mostly a drinking club who have no large scale plans. The Q people dont even know what they believe as it changes week to week. There really isnt an organized separatist movement and I doubt that dominionists (who actually exist) could muster enough numbers to be a legitimate military force.	None	None	0

This is somehow so relevant and I didn't realize until reading u/babalaghardaraak's comment, but the Ø(H)ÜS(H)TAGZ actually refer to anal penetration (ass portaling) as a metaphor or a literal way of viewing the phenomenon of *assimilation*. (ASS-imilation?) Think of the Ø(H)ÜS(H)TAGZ as being like a protocol for 'Unity' consciousness, where 'Unity' is the hive-mind lover of Rick Sanchez that assimilates entire planets in the episode, ["Auto-Erotic Assimilation"](https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Auto_Erotic_Assimilation).  **ØiNTERiOR. // ØiNTOREAR.**     Ø(H)ÜS(H)TAGZ don't shy away from the profane, in fact they delve right into it as part of a non-dual approach to the sacred. A string of Hushtags illuminates the post-monetary economy in finding one's true vocational purposefulness as the sixth out of six missions as being about finding 'love', which is essentially characterized and defined as finding that person that you can fart around and have it be 'OK'.      ***ØPLAYNiCE.*** \----> ***ØFiNDLOVE.*** \----> ***ØF'ÆRTWORK.***      ***ØPLAYNiCE*** describes 'how' to play the "ØTAMEGAME." It's a validation and re-instantiation of what is told to kids as they learn to play with others. If you do not play nice, you will not be able to advance to the next levels of socialization, you will be stuck in a certain sphere and unable to progress to the next part, which is:     ***ØFiNDLOVE*** describes this 'vague' and incredibly overused term 'LOVE' as being something of a game of perpetual hide-and-seek. You wouldn't have it any other way. In any given functional relationship, this theme continues to play its'elf out as being necessary to thrive. You continue to 'find' more things to love in your partner for example. And once you've done that, once you've 'found love', it follows that you can then:     ***ØF'ÆRTWORK*** sees having the dimension of 'work', which can seem to be like the ultimate ultimatum in this late capitalist nightmare-scape be something akin to flatulence. In other words, effortless, trivial, natural, pervious. It's not that your work doesn't matter, it's just that it matters less. It matters the correct amount for you to have a life worth living.         Strung in-between this sequence is another sequence:      ***ØPAWSPLAY. ----> ØNiCEFiND. ----> ØLOVEF'ÆRT.***  &#x200B;  **ØPAWSPLAY.** (Consent Protocol = Pause/Play)     **ØNiCEFiND.** ("Nice Catch", "Are you two an item?" objectifying relationships as a necessary and inevitable part of the tame game-- everyonė is commodifiable and feels safe as such in the context of a loving relationship where themes of ownership are synonymous with intimacy and care.)     **ØLOVEF'ÆRT.** [Matthew Silver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beB1Iwp1FHU) is a Street Performance artist from NYC involved in what he calls the "LOVE-FART AWAKENiNG." \*fffpfpfpppphhhhhh\* love for art, live for art. Life is suffering, life is about becoming the painting.         **ØPAiNTiNG. // ØPAiNKiNG. // ØPAiNRiNG.**     **ØPAiNTiNG** is art as verb and noun, but mostly verb(ign). Sometimes the 'iNG' are switched around to 'iGN' to denote the acronym: "iN GLOBAL NETWORK". Painting is the ecstacy of living life as art, living in flow, colour, texture, feeling, experience.     **ØPAiNKiNG** is the Breadwinner (French: Pain). It is the one who has the money, the bread, the 'dough' in this post-agrarian age, whether the dough equates to fiat, Bitcoin or literal bread. Living, surviving, being physically incarnate is wrought with 'pain' and 'suffering' (Life if Suffering) and so the king of pain is also the one who can withstand the most or has the highest pain threshold.      **ØPAiNRiNG** is both (loosely) the commitment of marriage, committing for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health to anything or anyone, but someone or something in specific. Juxtaposed to that, there are pedophilia rings and similar rings of corruption that this hushtag illuminates. The answer to ending this type of corruption, which runs deep within the psyche of humanity is genuinely pursuing the path of self-mastery, self-sacrifice and adopting a radical sense of responsibility and ownership.

Reykjavik is the capitol of Iceland, which is an island situated between Europe and Greenland.   Are you thinking of The North Atlantic Ocean but wrote North America?	Even though Reykjavik is in North America I figured flairing the post as Europe was appropriate since Iceland is a European country.  Edit: OK so it seems like it's uncommon knowledge that a big part of Iceland (the west coast and about half of the north) is in North America as the tectonic plates between North America and Europe meet through Iceland. About 3rd of Iceland is in North America including the vast majority of our population. Had no idea this was such an unknown but I'm happy to share some knowledge! 	None	About a 3rd of Iceland is in North America including the southern peninsula, the capital region, and Akureyri. Meaning the vast majority of the Icelandic population is in North America.

Your active service years will calculate as 365 "points" per year and contribute to a pretty nice pension.	I can retire with pension/benefits splitting 10 years AD/reservist?

gj50yoq	Anyone else see the Scotiabank commercial?	That was my take on it too.      Those guys, and Gord's fam, will never have another payday again that's not related to somehow licensing their product for these kinds of uses.     I'll also add on to the Spotify thing... they were huge in Canada, but didn't really break out anywhere else in a big way. So the nostalgia/classic rock market is pretty small to begin with, and nonexistent without their best-known member.   It's a hard old world, and I won't begrudge them building themselves a financial cushion against it.	I just saw the commercial on TSN. I was disappointed at first but then I wondered about how the surviving members of the Hip and Gord's family will make out now. Maybe the ongoing royalties are ok, but given the way Spotify works (paying the artists next to nothing), I can't blame them for licensing the use of one of their signature songs.	None	None	0

Are you sure you can't adjust it if?  You would likely be looking for a "Manual" setting option. Bios GUIs are often confusing, Sometimes there is stuff that is buried or you need to scroll down to.  As an alternative, a utility such as Ryzen Master can be used to adjust memory voltage, though I am not a fan of adjusting system parameters from withing Windows,  Since it is very common to operate memory at 1.35 volts for overclocking, you are probably in no immediate danger, You might get a support ticket from ASUS and see what their reaction is.

gjb8jna	White privilege theory is logically correct	Saying "I can't think of a single example in American life where white don't have *the* advantage" frames the entire discussion in a way that nullifies (or at least trivializes) the suffering that white folks experience. The fact that they suffer for reasons not related to their identity doesn't make it any less valid or worthy of care. Until the left (of which I am a member, might I add) can find a way to effectively and WILFULLY navigate around this problem, I genuinely don't think any meaningful progress will be made.  I think the language used to describe certain problems in society is a big hurdle preventing well-meaning people on the left from getting through to others.   Even whites experience racism. Sure, it's not a often as POC because there are *more* white folks, but it still happens. My best friend's parents growing up didn't want anything to do with me because I'm white. They're Puerto Rican. (And no, this isn't the kind of "suffering" i was referring to earlier.)	Actually, I'd say that's precisely what WP contends with. WP wouldn't be a thing if it meant that all races have equitable advantages. But it is not equitable. I can't think of any context in American Life, whites don't have the advantage/privilege. Moreover, the existence of privileges for other races, doesn't tell you much; the question is: to what extent? I'm sure there are aspects about being a woman in Pakistan, that are more beneficial than being a man. Despite that, I don't think any of us would argue that we'd rather be a man over a woman in Pakistan. Net/net, among the sexes, men have the privilege, andby a wide margin.	 The concept of white privilege only falls apart when one denies that there is inherent privilege in every intersectional identity. Everything has an upside and a downside.	None	0

I've always wondered if Troughton's portrayal of Ramon Salamander  at all influenced Pacino when he played Tony Montana	I think the story I feel the most 'forgiveness' towards is 'The Face of Evil'. It has an intriguing premise which is resolved in a very disappointing way that utterly fails to make use of the mechanics available or to deliver much of a moral lesson. That said, it has a brilliant setting and can even be, at a few points, genuinely disturbing. It also features (in fact it opens on) the first appearance of THAT costume, but given that Leela's actual characterisation is a feminist step forward, I'm willing to overlook that.

Isn't it the left that differentiates between gender and biological sex? Doesn't "son" refer to a male offspring and "daughter" to female? It is not the obligation of the speaker of a message to speak in a way that the listener finds acceptable. The listener can simply choose to NOT listen if the speaker doesn't appeal to them. But mandating that language be manipulated to fit whatever shaped box the listener desires is how few speech dies and things like Newspeak become reality.

Being threatened with being arrested because he didn't know my friends and I had permission to leave campus.  Having my friend patted down and locker searched because a rich white kid said the Mexican kid was selling drugs (he wasn't, the rich white kid just didn't like him).  Being told that he'd "fuck us up" if we ever got into any trouble outside school.  When someone spray painted a bunch of swastikas on the buildings, he didn't do shit because he wasn't there to "deal with graffiti".  I'm glad you had a sro that made you feel safe.  That sure as he isn't the case for all, or maybe even most, students	I had a cop at my high school. I only ever heard great things about him. All of my interactions with him were fun and lighthearted. He even kept me from skipping class a few times. Going to high school in the post-Columbine era was always spooky, and having his presence on location was always a little extra peace of mind.   I vividly remember one fight he broke up between two rival gang members. One guy pulled a knife on the other and was getting ready to go in for some slashes.

Yeah, he can clearly be better (though not kicking the field goal was 100% the correct choice).

gjmgwcc	In 1904, mandatory vaccination was enacted in Rio due to a smallpox epidemic. A proof of vaccination was required to apply for jobs and school. Soldiers invaded people's homes to apply the vaccine. There were riots, mutiny, and an attempted coup, but the rebellion was eventually subdued.	The only reason it took longer in the past was because of red tape.  The safety data for phase 2 and phase 3 trials is already out (which is how it got approved) and has the same run of the mill side effects as other vaccines.    I will always be amazed at the libertarians who are squeamish about the vaccine because the red tape was removed.  Its not an example of a "rushed and dangerous vaccine" so much as it should be a clear and obvious example of how before the pandemic the government was gumming up the pipeline of life saving treatments.   Having looked at the Phase 3 data myself, the risk for more severe side effects is less than 1%, some of those side effects being "severe pain" at injection site. Only an even smaller handful are emergencies, like high fever or severe allergic reaction. Which again, is in line with pretty much every vaccine we have.   Early data on the 1.8 million people who got vaccinated (this is a tiny bit dated) this past month was that there were *12* severe allergic reactions. This is an exceedingly safe vaccine.	And to make things worse, COVID is not nearly as dangerous as smallpox was. If you want to take the COVID vaccine, it should be up to you. But I think it will be a while until we have a truly safe and well documented vaccine. I think the average development time for a vaccine is 6-7 years... we are at year 1 and they are already pushing mandatory vaccines.	None	I mean, if you're under 50 with no preexisting conditions your odds of even being seriously ill from covid are vanishingly small. The vaccine should be for people at risk, just like the flu vaccine. Nobody gives a shit if you don't have a flu vaccine. Nobody should give a shit about this thing either.	0

gjnrpqh	u/troll_berserker came up with an idea discussing color pie: Colors are not restricted in what effects they can have, but should be the least efficient/most restricted in their respective weaknesses. I made a few commons to bring this idea to life.	&gt;This also incentivises you to print *bad cards* to serve as these boundary outlines, which means you're deliberately making bad cards, which, maybe instead, don't do that.  WotC makes deliberately bad cards all the time. I don't see eye-to-eye with MaRo all the time, but his two articles on why [WotC makes bad cards](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/when-cards-go-bad-revisited-2012-10-22) are some of the most insightful essays on TCG design out there (basically the design equivalent of "Who's the Beatdown?"). They're definitely a seminal read, and while they are centered around Constructed play, the need for bad cards to fill niches in Limited environments goes even further for enriching the draft experience and providing the holy grail of Limited experience: winning with bad cards.   &gt;Some effects are shallow enough that if every colour can do them 'just not well' then you create a situation where the impression players has is that these effects are not *part* of an identity, but are instead *shared*.  We don't actually entirely disagree on this. This is what I outlined as a problem with colorless card design, that they already break the colorpie *by proxy*, e.g. there are no restrictions against you putting Karn Liberated to get rid of a Rhystic Study, Smothering Tithe, or Sphere of Safety in your Mono Red EDH deck. In fact, Karn Liberated is an absolute staple for any Mono Red deck that can get up to 7 mana for this reason.  Then the inevitable question that comes is, why not just play those colorless options instead? What's the issue with putting Karn, Ratchet Bomb, Lux Cannon, Blast Zone in all your Mono Red decks? Well I answered why there would be an [advantage to making a certain card colored rather than colorless](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/kymyhm/khm_cosmos_elixir_legenvd/gjj5urc?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). Besides the points I made in this comment, one that I forgot is that generic answers like Karn Liberated or Ugin the Spirit Dragon can get quite expensive! Specifically colored cards give more options for budget players that they don't have to fight over with every other deck that wants Karn or Ugin.	Troll berserker is wrong.  Some effects are shallow enough that if every colour can do them 'just not well' then you create a situation where the impression players has is that these effects are not *part* of an identity, but are instead *shared*.  If you do something *once*, players in spaces like this assume that thing is guaranteed precedent, and therefore, the colour pie becomes meaningless sludge.  This also incentivises you to print *bad cards* to serve as these boundary outlines, which means you're deliberately making bad cards, which, maybe instead, don't do that.	None	Deliberately bad cards are fine, but I strongly disagree with the implication that colorless cards break the color pie by proxy.  It is perfectly fine if monocolor decks can achieve results they otherwise couldn't, inefficiently, by using colorless options. The color pie is about what cards of certain colors can and cannot do, *not* what a deck in that color identity can do. It is only through the highly specific lens of designing cards for EDH that "bad colorless answers" become de facto colored cards. I also do not think that designing cards such that they do things a color cannot do, but with an extremely conditional hoop to jump through or an extra effect tacked on, is good for the health of the color pie; it inevitably reframes the question as "why is X color so bad at Y thing" and encourages pushing the designs to muddy everything together, instead of accepting that X color *can't* do Y thing.   Also, while I accept that bad cards need to exist, I'm also not certain that the game needs an entirely new category of bad cards specifically for color pie breaks that are competitively unviable. The game doesn't need to be designed so that every EDH deck can get access to every sort of effect in-color and the designers don't need to find inefficient ways to fill every colors weakness for that reason. It also represents a *lot more* cards than the normal bad rate cards, because you're talking about making 3-4 bad versions of every effect to give to the 3-4 colors that don't normally get access to it. And when you're talking about a lot of bad cards of a given effect in every color, you're muddying "what color is good at what effect" a lot more.  As far as this specific example, these cards aren't really doing what you intended; while these are so narrow it's hard to say they're strictly worse than a colorless option, the horrible rate + conditional nature means these are absolutely on the "so weak it's strictly worse than colorless and worthless to print" spectrum.	0

Just teleporting horde mode until they just give up lol	and the funny part is, we're not even sure they're going to fix this.	This is what I've been saying since day 1 and I've had the comments buried with downvotes every time.  Given what we saw in the 48 minute demo, they either hand-made an assload of animations, made everything run on rails and basically spent a bunch of time making a 48 animated fake movie for a game that didn't exist back then, or these systems did in fact exist and were yanked out.  Both times the game was delayed, all the rumors were that the game was delayed because they were struggling to get the game running on then current/now last gen hardware. To which CDPR denied those rumors and said it ran great, though why have the delays otherwise?  We're left to believe a HUGE team had 8 years of overall development (3 years of smaller teams mainly doing pre-production and 5 years of full on production) and they just never once got around to basic AI systems while actively promising for years the most advanced AI ever seen?  We have to believe they both lied about what the roadmap and features were, they made an exceptionally fake gameplay video (which would require a bunch of work to fake rather than working on the game) and somehow this never leaked, OR a more complete game was gutted to get it to run on a base model PS4.  I suspect that the base model PS4 specifically struggled with the CPU load of the game, which is why even with a better GPU and memory bandwidth it runs worse than the base model XBox version in some ways. I think the CPU is the big bottleneck, so they removed global scripts, AI, game mechanics and systems that were causing CPU load.  However, no one at CPDR seems to want to admit to either scenario. Which is more likely? What really happened? I don't know.  HOWEVER, if more advanced systems were gutted because older consoles can't run them, I hope they resurface for an Enhanced or Director's Cut version on PC and next gen consoles.	0

gjpfxzk	Hi, not an otherkin but this is cool	Parogenesis (a word for tulpamancy that doesn't carry that cultural appropriation baggage) is a form of plurality, as is DID. Plurality comes in many forms, and it's a great tragedy for plural people and a source of stigma that almost all mainstream plural representation is DID. DID is a traumagenic and disordered form of plurality, and many plural people have to intrdouce themselves by saying "by the way, my plurality isn't caused by trauma and it's entirely healthy".	Tulpamancy sounds like DID, honestly.	None	None	0

More information will be available when it arrives in the UK.*   So according to them it hasn't even arrived in the UK. But it's been a week since the Polish post said it was sent from Warsaw.	If the Royal Mail website says its in transit and the Polish post is saying that it left Poland that means its stuck at an airport somewhere but hasnt cleared customs yet.   Everything is just very slow at the moment.	None	Things aren’t officially in the UK until it clears customs. Obviously Royal Mail don’t scan items straight off the plane, it goes in for inspection first and then gets handed to Royal Mail.

gjqv4ll	Lavos and Cedo Acquisition Post Orphix Venom	I like having the blueprint first because it shows you which parts you already have and which ones you don't.    I wish prime main blueprints were the lowest tier rewards for this reason.	Shouldn't the components and blueprint have their tier swapped, so that you can start building the components to be ready for when you hit the higher tier and unlock the main blueprint?  It doesn't make sense to give the player a blueprint at tier 2 that they can't build until they get tier 3.	None	They should have changed the whole system long ago, when it became clear that the foundry was going to be a cluttered mess.   If you want a good laugh, sort by "Type" and look at the individual tabs. Especially "Gear". Find the method to THAT madness. (It only looks at the display name, with uses alphanumeric with alphanumeric ordering of quantity prefixes, so after "10x" you get "100x" and not "20x". You also get "10x vapor specters" between "10x squad shield restore" and "100x ciphers", instead of grouping specters and restore pads together. You know? Ordered by Type.)  A better setup would have been to reveal the blueprint when you got any part of an item, then require a new 5th item to begin the build. So, you get an Ivara Chassis, the Ivara entry/blueprint appears like now, but with a 5th item checkbox (let's call it a 'frame fusion core'). To apply the frame fusion core, you need the other components built/present, which is the role the BP item now.  That would keep the same time gates and they could add 'accelerated fusion cores' that halve or remove the build time as drops or purchases. That adds flexibilty to the monetization - you can forbid cores from individual components to ensure folks can't just pay their way out of the full purchase, it adds another level of obfuscation to the costs (if no one has a problem with Orokin Catalysts or Reactors, they should be fine with this, even if I don't like either), and adds another in-game currency that they can manipulate.  To make up for the added space needed to display the longer list of items, get rid of the stupid icons that are identical, the worthless half sentence hover-over description, and shrink the massive, yet nearly empty boxes for each entry. Building frames and weapons should have a different interface from smelting ore and making health packs.   Of course, none of this will happen. The foundry is completed content, so the best we can hope for is a new texture to the orbiter model. It's a shame. So much wasted potential.	0

gjr9cd4	Looking for a USB WiFi setup for a G9 Pro	I contacted support about it several months ago when the phone was new, but their only suggestion was to send the phone back, with no attempt at troubleshooting the issue before that, no loaner to mirror it to while waiting, and no word about how long I'd be without a phone. So if I did that I'd need to buy and switch to a new phone while this one was out. And if I did that, what would be the point of switching back to this phone when it finally came back (probably with the same problem because defective WiFi is a widespread issue with this model)?  Anyway, the phone recently started having charging issues as well and the thing is barely more than a year old, so at this rate I'll probably be forced to get a new (non-BLU) phone before the year is out regardless. But until that happens, it would be cool to be able to use an external WiFi adapter. :)	I'm not sure about the wificard, but if your phone is less than 1 year old I would try send it back to them. I was getting the screen unresponsive bug that caused me to lock and unlock my phone when the screen didn't work.

But with the slim majorities Democrats have in both the House and Senate and the way Republicans have telegraphed their intent to obstruct just like before, I think we'll be lucky to get this.  Biden is and always has been a centrist. He'll always look for the middle ground while allowing Republicans to define where the middle lies. He's not the leader we need right now, but hopefully a real leader will rise out of this. Maybe Harris, maybe AOC, maybe someone we haven't noticed yet. But we have to make sure that Republicans don't undermine this administration with their disinformation so take back power in the House and Senate.

Assassins are less suited to bosses since a boss can go invincible while the bomb is in midair, and it can potentially hit everything in range, so its damage should probably be a bit lower, but I'd be interested in seeing the poison have some other effects as well, maybe for crowd control?	Easiest assassin buff would be a straight increase to poison damage. Make the damage per mana per second greater than wizard spell since wizard already has the benefit of long range	None	I suggested a weakness debuff for poison back when Deca took direct suggestions, they said no. They don’t want to add more stacking debuffs to the game	0

It can be your kitchen, your books, your closet. idk, anything. but it has to be something you put effort into. UwU	Yes(?) aren't things supposed to be arranged in a manner where it looks systematic and pleasing to the eyes?	0
