It does not mean that this translates into a diet that's healthier than other healthy ways of eating, and most people who aren't indoctrinated by vegan propaganda have concerns about the lack of of bioavailable nutrients (particularly fat soluble vitamins and proteins) on a WFPB diet.

 It also does not follow that the reason that a junk-food diet shows worse short-term results than WFPB is that the junk-food diet contains more meat.

Hi Tundey! You have fallen prey to the false dilemma fallacy (also known as the false dichotomy fallacy) when you posited that if someone is an activist they cannot be an effective president. These two things are not mutually exclusive. Have a nice day","&gt;Bernie has always been an activist

Exactly. There's a difference between being an activist and being a president. For example, Presidents (usually) have to be pragmatic. Activists do not. A president says ""Medicare for All is the best option but ObamaCare is a good start"". An activists says ""Medicare for All or we burn this shit down"". And there's nothing wrong with either person taking their positions. I want my activists pushing for the best to drive the agenda forward; and I want my presidents (politicians) not afraid to take a good deal instead of waiting around for the best deal.","HERE

BERNIE



Say what you will, Bernie was doing this when it actually wasnt the popular thing to do. No other candidate can say they have a picture like this at that age because no one else was doing it. Regardless of what you think of politicians, Bernie has always been an activist first. He still is, as much as someone at his age can be.

Yeah its corny but that's by today's standards. Bernie means what he says.","&gt;when you posited that if someone is an activist they cannot be an effective president.

I didn't say that. I'm sure there are some people who have both skills but I don't think Bernie is one of them. He's not known for being a consensus builder in the Senate. He's known for being a cantankerous guy who won't vote for bills because of some tiny amendment tucked within them. He has no major legislation to his name. On the other hand, as an activist he's successfully brought into the mainstream a bunch of ideas that were considered too wacky a few years ago.

This is a black or white fallacy. It's basically saying either your data isn't important or your data is uber important. In reality, there are various levels in between. In the latter cases, a single power loss protected slog will work just fine.","TL;DR: Don't bother.

Honestly, you probably don't even want a SLOG. You always have a ZIL, it is just either on the pool or the SLOG. Unless your work load has enough `sync` to cause slow downs, it isn't going to help. And if you *do*, you can achieve the same thing w/ `sync=disabled` on that dataset. If your in flight writes are *so important* that you can't do that, then you should be using a *mirrored* SLOG *and* it should be power fail safe *and* it should be fast at writes. It'll only get read in the case of an oh shit, so read speed doesn't matter. Most people think SLOG is a write cache, but it isn't. It is just a place for `sync` writes to live in case the system fails before that `sync` data in memory can be written to the pool as part of a normal flush.

The article [ZFS sync/async + ZIL/SLOG, explained](https://jrs-s.net/2019/05/02/zfs-sync-async-zil-slog/) by /u/mercenary_sysadmin is a good read about SLOG.",None,"Sure, there are no ZFS police and you can do anything you want. And every use case is different too. I'd put SLOG or L2ARC on anything for learning, why not. But it is important to know what it is for.

If you've decided to *protect* your in flight writes, you've probably got a UPS too. Maybe even redundant power supplies. If you've realized you need power loss safe SSDs, that is amazing. But then... why draw the line there? You care about in flight writes this much, but not that *one* little bit more where you run it mirrored in case one fails when you need it most?

If I changed anything, I'd probably reverse the order. I agree the power loss protection is more important than mirroring because power loss is *far* more likely than device failure. But device failure isn't exactly *rare* either.

As long as you make the choice *knowing* the consequences, its fine. But SLOG and L2ARC are rarely understood in a way that people realize the choice they're making. I know I certainly did.",0,,,The claim of this argument is that you should not bother having your operating system and Zork Implementation Language on the same SSD.

You surely don’t speak for most atheists. Atheism solely concerns itself with non-belief in deities. It makes no claims and itself is not concerned, related or applied to any other matter.


As far as individual atheists, there is no common atheist creed, code or agreed upon guidelines. An individual atheist is at liberty to form an opinion using whatever method they personally choose. They are free to be as rational or irrational as they want. You may argue how you approach [*insert topic*] but you may not speak to how other individual atheists approach it. The only thing you share with other atheists is – atheism: a lack belief in a deity.

288,ekmau2r,RE: Political apathy in Singapore,"&gt;	Fallacy of false dichotomy/burden of proof. A diner doesn't have to cook better than their chef to be a critic.

As expressed by the OP I agree this is a valid criticism.

However I believe the wider point was, don’t tear everything down because you’re mad.  We live ever more in an outrage era, and it’s quite easy to be manipulated by emotion.","&gt; First off, most people don’t really care THAT much about politics. But this applies to EVERYONE AROUND THE WORLD, not just Singaporeans. This anger I’ve read on this sub recently directed specifically at Singaporeans is mind boggling because it’s not like everyone else around the world is politically enlightened. In the US only 60% of the electorate voted in the 2016 presidential elections.

False equivalency. In the US people don't vote for various reasons, due to redlining, voter disenfranchisement, and the darn simple fact that election days are not holiday unlike here. On the other hand, it's somewhat an offense to not vote her, as your name gets struck off the registry and you'll have to pay a 50 dollars fine if you don't have a valid reason.  

Not all democracies are enlightened, but if the civil movements and waves of resistance movements in NA and EU are a yardstick of anything, it'll be the opposite of political apathy, at least generationally.

&gt; Furthermore, a lot of people are one-issue voters, which isn’t an informed way to make voting decisions either.

Why not? People vote on the platform that pushes their hot-issue buttons the most. Short-sighted as this may be, you yourself mentioned that we have a limited attention span and resources to read and digest manifestos, study the track record of politicians, or catch up on debates and town halls. Humans rely on heuristics when a quick judgement has to be made against resource constraints. Or, humans are lazy, so there is absolutely nothing wrong with voting along a single or several issues for elections. Advanced democracies do this. Brexit was predicated on a lie about NHS financing. Trump won because he painted his opponent to be more untrustworthy as him. In a perfect world, both wouldn't have happened, and I don't think anyone will deny that UK and the US are developed democracies.

&gt; Second, I’d say a lot of people need to read up on history more. The older generation wouldn’t be as outraged by this because the govt has ALWAYS been like. This tacit social contract between Singaporeans and govt has been in place since before a lot of people on this sub were born.

So what do you get by appealing to tradition? Just because we were in legit danger as a young country circa the Malayan Conspiracy times it means that we must uphold the same social contract our grandparents signed with the powers that be? We can't demand our government to a higher standard of accountability and transparency? We should be thankful that they don't jail all keyboard warriors under ISA 2.0 for 10 years for spreading fake news about TPTB because that's what they did to our forefathers during Coldstore? 

&gt; Third, if you’re vehemently against something, then please simultaneously think of the alternative solution you’d prefer. I see far too many people complain about specific policies (not specifically fake news law) without giving their own “better” alternative.

Fallacy of false dichotomy/burden of proof. A diner doesn't have to cook better than their chef to be a critic. The electorate shouldn't bear the burden of proof of coming up with alternatives to show that a policy sucks. There's a reason why the Government is supported by research institutes, think-tanks, polling agency and data analytics experts to formulate policies. Asking the layman to come up with a proper alternative or shut up, especially if that retort comes from TPTB, is an indictment against our paternalistic and top-down approach to democracy, that we are serving our MPs and Ministers instead of the other way round.

Still giving you an upvote, because end of the day what we need is this: proper fucking discourse. Not the phony electorate outreach program REACH they use to create phony and dodgy figures whenever they need polling numbers to support a controversial policy, but actual discourse amongst the electorate to be educated and politically aware if not motivated.",None,None,0,,,Too long. plus the context of fallacy is different

False dichotomy is a fallacy of false dilemma where we are given only two options to a situation or answers to a problem as the only possible options. In reality it **may** be quite different, with a number of other possibilities being available.

Very few situations are a definite either/or with only two available alternatives, they do however exist. 

To assume that there are no situation in which only two alternatives can exist could lead us to assume a false dichotomy fallacy has been committed when it may not have been. Nowhere is this more apparent that in matters of God. 
Assume for a moment that God dose in fact exist and that Christ is his son. If this is true then it would follow that there are in fact absolutes dealing with the nature of good and evil, either you are a follower of God or you are not, either because you are a non-believer or because you have been led astray (which was one of the primary reasons cited by Christ).

My point here is that from a philosophical religious standpoint in which we assume the existence of God, there do exist absolutes and issues to which there is no middle ground. ",0,,,The claim of this argument is that Christianity uses a false dichotomy fallacy in its teachings.

A red herring is something that misleads or distracts from a relevant or important issue. It may be either a logical fallacy or a literary device that leads readers or audiences towards a false conclusion. A red herring might be intentionally used, such as in mystery fiction or as part of rhetorical strategies (e.g. in politics), or it could be inadvertently used during argumentation.

***

**False dilemma**

A false dilemma is a type of informal fallacy in which something is falsely claimed to be an ""either/or"" situation, when in fact there is at least one additional option.

A false dilemma can arise intentionally, when a fallacy is used in an attempt to force a choice or outcome. The opposite of this fallacy is false compromise.

The false dilemma fallacy can also arise simply by accidental omission of additional options rather than by deliberate deception.

And neonicotinoid seed coatings aren't driving their health problems—here’s why | Genetic Literacy Project",I disagree with your concluding general rule statement as it has the logical fallacy of false dichotomy.,"I believe the data speak for themselves regarding the alleged profound negative impact of neonics. Since the data show no problem with honeybee populations that strongly suggests no issue.

Of course the counter will be that that somehow it is wild/native bees which are being affected. That seems unlikely because domestic bees are more likely to be around agriculture/neonics. However, wild/native bees are not livestock so it could be that beekeepers undo the damage but only to honey bees. 

Nevertheless, the general rule with pesticides is that you literally have to choose your poison: no pesticides leads to mass human starvation and greater environmental impact so you want to choose the safest ones you can.

Which also explains the benefit of glyphosate.","It's important for people to read the counter narrative so that you can be fully informed. This article suggests that an ideological undercurrent tied to the organic movement and environmental rights groups, combined with a shift in beekeeping economics is the source of untrue claims with regard to neonics.","It is not a false dichotomy.
