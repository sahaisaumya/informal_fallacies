>How do you know? Do you go to other people's yards to check that your cat didn't shit there?

Because they literally stay in my yard.  All my neighbors have aggressive pit bulls, my cats are smart enough to not go beyond my fences.  Plus they are clingy and follow me around all day.  When I leave the house,  my roommate is home and they will then cling to him until I'm back.

>The fallacy of relative privation. We are here to discuss cats' impact on the environment, not gangs.

My cats being mice murderers has a way smaller carbon footprint than the gangs in my area doing drive-bys on each other. Not only are they using 1980s Chevy Classic cars and those emissions, but when there's a dead person on the corner 8 police vehicles, an ambulance, fire truck, and 3 news crews show up. Then the family of the deceased has to get to the police station somehow, or a hospital, and then probably a few Court trips. 

This is why i mention that at all. 

But let's get back to the cats. My neighbors having chickens is attracting way more mice than usual. There are not too many snakes in my neighborhood because we are in the middle of a desert city, if I lived on the edge of town I could definitely rely on snakes to handle some of the rodent problem but since the snakes have all been pushed away, my cats are doing their due diligence and assisting with reducing the spread of disease.",1,"My neighborhood is full of gangs and I've heard people get murdered and attacked with my very own ears, I'm pretty sure my cats aren't the ones destroying my neighborhood or the environment","[(394, 396), (397, 409), (410, 412), (413, 417), (418, 420), (421, 426), (427, 430), (431, 432), (432, 435), (436, 441), (442, 448), (449, 452), (453, 461), (462, 465), (466, 474), (475, 479), (480, 482), (483, 487), (488, 491), (492, 496), (496, 497), (498, 499), (499, 501), (502, 508), (509, 513), (514, 516), (517, 521), (522, 525), (525, 528), (529, 532), (533, 537), (538, 548), (549, 551), (552, 564), (565, 567), (568, 571), (572, 583)]",Cats aren't the problem as there are gangs about the place

* 5th Card Problem
* Better Timer
* Improved Deckbuilder UI
* Friend Lists
* Etc

There are like a thousand things more important than tracking a specific deck's W/L ratio, especially since there are third party tools (or literally a pen and paper at your desk) that you can use to accomplish this. I'd prefer the dev team spend their time fixing the big, glaring issues the game has, rather than little QoL niceties such as this.","it's not a fallacy when someone is actually asking for the devs to spend time and resources on something that we would all agree is less important. the post isn't just saying ""this feature would be nice,"" it's saying ""we need this feature."" literally in the title. and it's really not even the fallacy of relative privation. in this case we are saying that spending resources on x is not worthwhile because it would detract from accomplishing y, which is more important. the fallacy of relative privation is an entirely different thing. it's where you put forth some criticism of something, and i brush it aside as trivial by making reference to some other thing which is worse. or the inverse, referring to some other thing which is better. it could also be a statement like ""x is not so bad because it could be y.""

all of those cases have something in common. they have nothing to do with expenditure of resources, since the fallacy doesn't hinge on value judgments at all - that's why it's a fallacy. it can only apply in non-zero-sum situations, not necessarily where time and resources are infinite or where the issues in question require none, but where time and resources don't even apply to the discussion. if i were instead to say ""stop whining about not having a win/loss counter, they could have designed the log system so that you couldn't even use a third party app to track it,"" then this would be a fallacy. but saying ""a w/l counter would be nice, but there are better ways to spend the developers' limited time and resources"" is not a fallacy. in the first scenario we're not pointing to any logically valid reason that developing a w/l counter would be bad for anything. we're just deflecting attention from the issue. in the second scenario we are only saying that developing a w/l counter would preclude the devs from developing things that we all consider more important.

it's like if you and your friend are stranded in the wilderness, and the nearest water is 10 miles to the east but food is 10 miles to the west. we all know what the obvious first priority is. but if your friend wants to get the food because he hasn't eaten in longer than you, and you say ""at least you have a stomach,"" you're still wrong. that's the fallacy. what you would really say is ""i know you haven't eaten in a while, but you can survive several days without food, but only a couple without water, especially while walking 20 miles. our best chance of survival is to go get the water first, then turn around and get the food."" this is obviously not a fallacy. it depends on basic axioms and one mutual belief - the axioms are things like ""surviving is a priority"" and ""priorities should be followed,"" and the only belief is that water is a higher priority than food. in some cases, for some people, it may not be. likewise, for some people, having a win/loss counter is more important than all the other things mentioned. but in large groups, the majority rules, and the vast majority of players share priorities.",0,,,Saying the user is using the fallacy

What he is asking, very obviously, is where exactly are the social crusaders of feminism when their middle eastern sisters are having their clits cut off by oppressive regimes, and why are they not accompanying him on the picket line?

I can give you an answer.  Most feminists aren't activists.  They are lazy, because their society is genuinely not that oppressive, and they don't need to protest because their own needs are mostly met.  There are plenty of issues to take with western society, particularly rape and on the male side, suicide, but for the most part we live better, longer, happier, more fulfilled lives than any civilisation in history.

Further, they don't like doing this because they feel uncomfortable protesting alongside right wing bigots who hate middle eastern people because they have the wrong skin colour, and the most important thing to a white feminist is to appear to be right, not to actually be right.

So yes, he is right to criticise.  In this case, the right wingers are correct.  The Saudis and Iranians are barbaric, and need to be more westernised.

I should also note that this is not abdicating responsibility for how these countries got in this mess in the first place.  I am well aware of the west's responsibility for all of this.
