efulqj4	WCSD rolls back their Regional Weather plan	I'm for something similar. Voters should try to petition for a salary cap ballot question. Something that prevents any WCSD employee from earning more than 4X the standard teachers salary. Get that fat bitch from Vegas out of there. Quit the nationwide "searches" for a new superintendent. Promote from within the people who actually want the job. Not people who suck on the money-teat of the government. 	I feel like we need to split it up into individual schools and fire everyone above the principals.  :)	I feel like we need to split up the district into smaller districts. Coming from Phoenix, they have 4 different districts in an area as big as Reno. Maybe the galena area gets a digital day, while the sparks area has a regular schedule. 	None	0

efymkmi	PSA: it’s going to snow all day	Same thing in manufacturing. We have deadlines to get product out. I had to work extra hours last week to cover for people who couldn't get in.   Looking at another 3 hour drive home here too I'm sure. 	Unfortunately if you work health care you have no option...	Just. Stay. Home.   Best advice ever.  Start a fire, play a board game, watch a movie, watch the snow fall. 	Came to say this. 	0
ehc4jxd	SMH...	&gt; our city planners want to grow grow grow even though our infrastructure doesn't support it  Do you really  think it works that way? That city planners build the freeway *first*, in hopes that future growth meets the new capacity? Reno's RTC definitely steps up to meet demand. Look at the pyramid/mc carran intersection redesign or the southeast corridor highway. 	I agree with your sentiment and am also frustrated by the fact that our city planners want to grow grow grow even though our infrastructure doesn't support it and they would rather spend all kinds of money for shitty freeway art instead of improving the freeways.      But you're way off base.      First, you are a giant hypocrite if you moved here too and are living in an RV complaining about transients, chief. You're no more a local than they are. You can get tf out with the rest of them tbh    Secondly, while housing prices are nuts, they aren't crazy enough to be out of your means. If you're already paying almost $1000 a month just to park your RV you can translate that into a place to live.      Third, comparing Reno to San Fran is just ignorant. Visit any big city and you'll see that Reno isn't half as bad as they are. If you think Reno has as bad an issue with homelessness and drug use as even Sacramento you're as sheltered as you propose others are.	None	Of course not. However they should have a plan if they are going to push that growth. Something beyond "a traffic bandaid here, a traffic bandaid there" which is what they've been doing for years even prior to our growth.       I disagree that they are meeting the demand and in some cases I truly believe the redesigns are worse. The redesigned on ramp entrance for S. 395 off N. McCarran for example is horrendous. Zero visibility for the lane you now have to merge into at high speeds with a very small window to do it. It's fine if you're a good driver but this is Reno we're talking about lol.	0
ei7tjgf	Sajid Javid is violating UN human rights.	Oops, they aren't as unsurrenderable as you thought.  &amp;#x200B;  \&gt;  ARTICLE 17    \&gt; Prohibition of abuse of rights    \&gt; Nothing in this Convention may be interpreted as implying for any State, group or person any right to engage in any activity or perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set forth herein or at their limitation to a greater extent than is provided for in the Convention.   [https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention\_ENG.pdf](https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf)	You never surrender human rights under any circumstance, that argument is ridiculous. You caring or not caring makes no difference, they all deserve proper justice for their actions according to British laws, not your set of "this is what I think" laws	In the old days it'd have been straightforward. Hang 'em. Problem solved.  No, I don't care about these girls nor do I give diddly squat about any so called rights. They surrendered any claim to them when they joined up with ISIS. Nor do I trust the "British" Muslim community to deradicalise them given they came out of the same "British" Muslim community to begin with and they have a terrible reputation with radicalism.   Deport 'em. I don't care about them. 	I don't follow your point. I read that quote as "Nothing here is to be violated by anyone. If there are higher standards of human rights than is in the convention, don't violate anything below that" 	0
ei83p1r	Sajid Javid makes me question the value of Muslim politicians | The Guardian	Stereotyping, actually.

ei9ib8l	Axe personal allowance and pay everyone £48 a week, says thinktank	The tax rate of Sweden etc with none of the benefits.	> The policy is likely to face opposition from some voters, as it would also mean bringing down the threshold for higher-rate taxpayers from 50,000 to 37,500. This is because the starting point for 40% income tax moves with the personal allowance. NEF said this would affect the top 13% of earners in the country.  What a great Tory-Lib-Labour tag team that would end up being for young professionals: fuck them over with the housing market so that they are eternally trapped in expensive rentals, raise a 9% Professionals Tax on them for most if not all of their working lives via tuition fees, and then raise them into the higher-rate tax threshold for a salary that could now buy them fuck all of anything.   Anyone with a professional degree has every reason to flee this country. 	None	Heh, they've already thought of that. Bye bye freedom of movement.  	0

eldjhbw	Has a blood clot. Gets upset doctors ask her about being obese. ✓	I'm not sure if they used 'move' intentionally here, or from habit, but iirc part of blood clot prevention is ambulation.  So it's appropriate in context, at least.	For some reason, I always find issue with the phrase "move" when used in this context. Why do they never say workout?  Edit: maybe I'm being nit picky. just because you move, doesn't mean you're actually pushing yourself to do something	None	"Eat less move more" is also a common slogan restating CICO for the masses. I don't think there's any agenda in that phrasing.	0

elymo1m	Fightful: Details on Lio Rush Heat	I can't speak for anyone else, but it is so fucking annoying when people bring their family in to work when they're not supposed to be there.  It is a job.  It's not a place to hang out.	Bringing random people and bringing the mother of your child is a little different though.	This reminds me of those stories about Enzo bringing whoever he wanted backstage during shows...   I hope he simmers down before he meets the same fate as the former Mr. Amore.	I think it's different in this case due to the amount of time most wrestlers spend away from their family. If he's an independent contractor and he's paying for her travel and room out of his own pocket, i don't see an issue with it.	0

epwtub1	Likes Mexicans as long as they make cheap stuff she can buy.	&gt; She has the right to not have her country repopulated by a foreign race.  If only us Native Americans were ever granted this "right" that seemingly only exists when it's non-white people doing the repopulating.  So, I take it you're strongly against the Israeli occupation of Palestine then?	This thread smells like an underground bathhouse.  She has the right to not have her country repopulated by a foreign race.  Only money dares take this right away, only redditors dare defend it with a sentimental meme.  It'd be called a crime against humanity if it was some african country instead of the US.  Good on her for liking Mexico, really nice people. Don't see how vanilla justifies the roundtrip, tho.	I am unable to see how the two are related.	If the Native Americans had formed a proper nation and designed a solid immigration policy, things would have worked out a lot better for them. Seems like a good idea tbh.	0

eqq3vyl	Fat cells aren't full of "LOVE" – they're an equal-opportunity hoarder that stores anything and everything for use at a later time. Adipose tissue’s tendency to store things is an unfortunate side-effect that includes harmful toxins, pollutants, and excess hormones.	Napthalene, from a termite nest inside their walls.	House had an episode where the patient was getting stuff from the fat, and it had to do with mouse poop or something.	I remember at least two medical dramas using this as a plot point. In one, a patient that was losing weight, had already lost a lot of weight, began getting really sick and they couldn't figure out why. Turned out the fat cells shrinking were freeing all those stored toxins into the body at once (I believe it was something to do with past drug use).  Great reason to never get fat. You could poison yourself by trying to fix the issue years later.	What a massive termite nest it was, too. I liked how the kid hallucinated the needed thing in order for House to do the necessary cat autopsy to figure out how to save the kid while everyone acted mildly disturbed.   Though I'm not sure how long term one's exposure to something like that would have to be in order to store enough away in fat without showing symptoms pre-injury weight loss while also not being overweight to begin with in real life. Or how anyone with a Naphthalene poisoned kitty cat would think it died of old age. Obviously it didn't if it was attacking people while they slept and more than likely displaying a host of other issues, but it is the reason I remember that episode.   At any rate, I would think that getting sick from stored toxins in fat would be pretty rare, given that rapid medically monitored weight loss programs are a thing regularly employed for morbidly obese patients for various things.	0
er6gvju	Just wondering if any of you do the “VS AI” PVE content in Overwatch	For what it’s worth, I can only remember one time recently (in months of playing) that someone in an AI training match was rude. Most people are just there to grind XP and lookboxes without having to PVP.  If you do training vs AI and pick Easy mode, there’s basically no way you’ll lose unless a bunch of people drop out. A lot of times people are just goofing around or trying new classes.  On hard, sometimes the AI does win, and in a match today three of us ended apologizing at once after a wipe out. That’s how chill the training v AI people are. :)	Playing vs AI is much less stressful for me, and helps me get used to characters, but I'm still scared my teammates are gonna get mad at me for being bad lol. I prefer doing bot only matches, the fear of running into people that aren't exactly nice is too much for me a lot of the time.	None	So I'm not gonna get shouted at for being unable to aim with Ana or putting my shield down at the wrong time with Rein? I know I just need to jump into it and have fun, because that's what games are about, but it's real hard sometimes. Thanks for the reassurance.	0

It's kind of hard to prove a value wrong, tbh. Or an opinion for that matter.	Trying to impose your values and opinions on others when they have proven to be wrong time and time again.	Yeah, you know I meant opinions on moral matters, not on scientific ones where there is no real room for opinions. Don't be disingenuous.  >We are a child sacrificing household  Let's discuss and actual value if you want, not a bullshit strawman. Let's take monogamy or fidelity in marriage, for example, lots of people have it as one of their core values. Or polygamy/non-monogamy, quite a few believe that there's no reason to restrict yourself if both partners agree to it.   There's no way to prove either of them as "wrong" and they're directly contradicting each other.	0
esi13j5	Donations Pour In For Jewish Group Arrested Protesting ICE Detention Centers: ‘We Are Seeing The Signs Of A Mass Atrocity’	Bosses that are callously unaccommodating should see the inside of a camp.	If we leave our jobs to protest, we will be left without an income, social support, and health care, which means our lives will quickly go down the drain.	Why aren't there millions of protestors.

esi1eq6	Donations Pour In For Jewish Group Arrested Protesting ICE Detention Centers: ‘We Are Seeing The Signs Of A Mass Atrocity’	Traditional Jewish anti-camp behavior ought to be respected in a free country.	No. We aren't seeing the signs of a mass atrocity. Just because a group of protestors was Jewish doesn't mean they were targeted or arrested for that reason. They were disrupting the work being done there and that is illegal. Another clickbait headline to grab the attention of people.	None	They were disrupting government work. It’s illegal.

esi4nqh	Donations Pour In For Jewish Group Arrested Protesting ICE Detention Centers: ‘We Are Seeing The Signs Of A Mass Atrocity’	&gt;It's not an atrocity  Well, that's your opinion. 3000+ missing kids is not an atrocity? Jesus, what is? Where do you grow a heart?  &gt;It's a shame that liberals donate so much money to people arrested for protesting illegal migrant detention centers but don't give a cent to help the enslaved pygmies throughout Africa or Uyghurs being rounded up into actual concentration camps by the Chinese government.  They don't donate to that or do anything else about it? Citation needed. Also, starving people in Africa doesn't better conditions next door. That's not how it works.  &gt;They care about what the media tells them to care about, not the actual well being of their fellow man.  Now that's just uncharitable.   &gt;And maybe people shouldn't be entering our country illegally  It's 100% legal to jump the border and ask for asylum, period. It's the law, respect it.	 ICE Detention Centers should be better quality but this is getting ridiculous. It's not an atrocity and people protesting it don't need or deserve your money. It's a shame that liberals donate so much money to people arrested for protesting illegal migrant detention centers but don't give a cent to help the enslaved pygmies throughout Africa or Uyghurs being rounded up into *actual* concentration camps by the Chinese government.

esi6hdu	Donations Pour In For Jewish Group Arrested Protesting ICE Detention Centers: ‘We Are Seeing The Signs Of A Mass Atrocity’	So, for starters, after the Jews migrated to Europe they were subject to pogroms and expulsions for hundreds of years. In the Nazi era, mass expulsion was attempted and failed. This lead to camps where death occurred en mass from disease and poor supplies, like soap and whatnot. Then, after expulsion became an impossibility, the final solution was extermination. Some camps weren't extermination camps though, like Dachau probably never used the gas chamber as it held many political prisoners. Once the allied forces neared, then extermination began by death marches and hangings to spitefully prevent liberation.  This is overly simplistic and you should read more about it elsewhere.	So what if they are Jewish. Yes, they were arrested and maybe that's wrong or maybe it isn't, but the implication here is they were arrested *because* they were Jewish.   Secondly, why would something like the Holocaust occur here if the government is trying to *deport* migrants?   It'd be hard to kill people if they, ya know... were somewhere else.	None	None	0

It’s pretty close to 50/50:  https://www.theesa.com/esa-research/2019-essential-facts-about-the-computer-and-video-game-industry/	Thats a tricky one. While my parents never minded me playing games they did not want me to play anything violent like gta:sa or similar. However if everyone playing those games would become a sociopathic mass murderer the current state of the world would look way worse.   They may base their assumptions on the old media witchhunt on fps games. However studies showed that there is no provable correlation between violence in video games and violence in real life. Those who played video games and showed violent tendencies had those before and used gaming as a form of escapism.  What may help your parents to understand you better may be studies showing that and maybe a female rolemodel engaged with video games. Also the amount of women playing video games is not as low as many may think. While not 50/50 its still more then the handful some may think. I dont have any links on hand (and dont know if I even could post them) but I still hope I could help you a bit.	None	Thats interesting, thought its close to 60/40.	0
etrynxf	Gaming online sometimes feels like an undercover mission	As a female player, it’s a tough call. Obviously in a post-gamergate era many of us have been shamed/scared/harassed into silence. On the one hand I don’t want to give dbags an excuse to ruin my gaming time. On the other, maybe if more of us spoke up, the situation would become more normalized. IDK.	Ah this reminds me that i made the mistake of assuming an enemy player in an overwatch comp game was a guy because I typed it so quickly during respawn, and when corrected I just apologised for it which I think brought more attention to it. It was the worst feeling knowing I did this to another girl because I hate that I made her out herself to her team and my team when she corrected me in match chat (idk if she was in their comms or not). Def tried to use gender neutral language after the fact but I felt like it was too little too late :/	I resubbed to WoW this week because I stubbornly must unlock flying for each xpac. I’ve kept General chat on in the new questing zones because it actually hasn’t been that terrible (yet), aside from the occasional “we raped/were raped by (other faction)”. It probably helps that I play in the morning on weekdays mostly.  But every time a rare goes down and someone casually says “we did it, boys”, I clench my jaw a little and start to type “and girls”, and then I remember it’s not fucking worth it. So I just go back to destroying the stupid damage meters and calling out rare coords.  (Someone did actually type “how are we doing, gnomes and gnomettes” this morning, which I thought was cute even though we are Horde.)	yeah i just apologised and someone was like "ImAgInE assuming their GENDER" in match chat to which i just went nah its not a big deal calm down and we moved on, I hope no one on their team gave them crap in team chat where i couldnt see it.

etypggb	"Even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that is something that god intended to happen." ~Richard Murdock	I don't believe that there is a fundamental lack of empathy: just a perversion of it. As someone who has a lot of right-leaning family members, they're simply heavily rooted in the "tough love" mentality, as worthless as that may be.	You have to understand the lack of empathy for humans that rightwing people have.   To be right wing is to fundamentally lack genuine empathy for fellow humans.   religion is also a key enabler in creating the us and them it dehumanizes others by the use of lables.	None	The one basic difference between right and left people if you sit them down and interview them in large studies. The one main difference is empathy. To be left as a generalization is to want human beings treated with decency no matter who they are.  To be right is to create laws or reasons or excuses that enable humans to be mistreated. Rightwing people as a generalization have higher fear and anger responses they perceive people of different ethnicity as a threat.	0

It's sickening that there are people, powerful people who have a voice in government and media, who believe and say these things.

ewekd74	Texas Congressman says if El Paso shooter is charged with a hate crime, pastors will be next	You just explained to me why I always thought the idea of hate crimes was bizarre. Thank you.	Unpopular opinion I think, but 'hate crimes' are superfluous and unnecessary definitions. Charge people with the crime they committed, not what they were thinking when they committed it.  Killing someone because they're an immigrant, or because they're white, or because they're hindu shouldn't be any different than killing them for their political views, or their favourite movie. It gives credence to the idea that there's 'better' or 'worse' reasons to kill someone, or that your life was worth more because you were killed because of your race rather than your sports team.

ewolurf	I'm not sure if a caption is needed for this one.	 I always like the angle of asking someone what they would think if someone would tell them anything about their job, that they know is wrong. What they would think if someone is thinking they know better after a google search.  Science isn't on her side, scientists are not on her side, people who studied this and doing this all day every day in multiple fields are not on her side. Your mother wouldn't even understand what methods these people use to come to the conclusion, but she knows they are wrong. Sure.  https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/4/048002  &gt; The consensus that humans are causing recent global warming is shared by 90%–100% of publishing climate scientists according to six independent studies by co-authors of this paper. Those results are consistent with the 97% consensus reported by Cook et al (Environ. Res. Lett. 8 024024) based on 11 944 abstracts of research papers, of which 4014 took a position on the cause of recent global warming.	Ok, please don't downvote me for this, I'm just genuinely curious and want to know. My mom says global warming isn't real, I say it is. I try to counter her arguments but every time she ends up winning the debate because, 1 I suck at arguing, and 2, I suck at doing research. So since she always wins I'm beginning to think she's right, but I don't want to since I believe its real. I just don't know anymore. Can someone explain how its real? And how its not, (as my mom says) Earth's "natural cycle" or "a use so the government can make money"?

ez6xlt0	[Opinion] Riot Didn't learn from their mistakes with Nexus Blitz and is doing the same thing with TFT	Because they know that the auto-chess genre was going to bring in Money. No hearthstone players are coming to your client to play shitty Nexus Blitz. No other MOBA players are coming over to spend money on Nexus blitz.   Now that TFT has been "dialed in" and there's no real radical game changes coming - people understand the algorithm execution of the game and moved on.   It's boring sitting around for 40 minutes just picking out cards and having no agency in the combat.  You're literally the equivalent of a grandma playing nickel slots with her treasure trolls in Vegas as a "gamer".   I don't know where you kids came from but OG video gaming was all about agency and skill.   This game completely strips that away and is a fucking snore fest.   TFT will die out the same because the entire genre gets dialed in way too fast ("Here's the 2-3 meta builds of the week. Play these or sink.") and needs way too much maintenance to stay fresh.	The question is why? What makes TFT objectively more keep-worthy than Nexus Blitz?	Only that TFT will not be removed because "participation lowered".	Just wanted to say there are going to be some radical changes with the new items being added and there will probably be a lot more changes when there are more champs added. Also TFT requires skill but it's not mechanical skill it's understanding what you can do / should be doing to give yourself the advantage over the other players in the game.   To me playing games isn't about showing off your sick skills or whatever, it's about having fun.	0

Its one thing to be terrified of protesters, but for a citys police force to display intimidation tactics like this is next level.

ezum52a	Vegan activists 'cause death of 100 rabbits' with rescue raid, famers claim	Veganism is abolitionist, not welfarist. No matter how well you treat the rabbits, you still kill them well before their time for no good reason. That's never excusable, and the only way to treat them actually respectfully is not to raise them for meat in the first place.	I think groups like this should focus on the treatment of these animals, not the fact that people eat them.	None	 Agriculture to produce wheat, rice and pulses requires clear-felling native vegetation. That act alone results in the deaths of thousands of animals and plants per hectare.  Producing wheat and other grains results in at least 25 times more sentient animals being killed per kilogram of useable protein, more environmental damage through soil erosion, and a great deal more animal cruelty than does farming red meat. Grass fed cows however are carbon negative and one of the most densely nutritious foods available.	0

f264048	GRRR EATING AT CHICK FIL-A MAKES YOU A AWFUL PERSON	You would surprised at who donates to The Salvation Army or at least partners with them. Target, UPS, FedEx, Amazon, Google, etc.	Its kind of murky because most Christian nonprofits are run by more conservative Christians, meaning the way they run their organizations, whether in a big way or a small way, tends to be homophobic.  Theyre no longer donating to explicitly anti-gay nonprofits (which is good), but theyre currently donating to nonprofits which, though they dont exist to oppose gay rights like the nonprofits they used to donate to, still have policies which discriminate against gay people.  For example, the Salvation Army actually has a pretty notable history of anti-LGBT policies, even though anti-LGBT activism isnt what the organization does.  I think what this comes down to for a lot of people, though, is that Chick-Fil-A has burned bridges with a lot of the LGBT community, and thats not something people are going to forget.

fcimns2	Things to do on New Year's Eve in Boulder?	It's $175 a person per ticket before fees.  That gets you in the door, buffet, and champagne at midnight, but anything additional (like any drinks) is on top of that.  I know there's plenty of folks where that's nothing, but I think that's too rich for my blood.	License Number One had an awesome party last year, but you need to buy tickets in advance as they'll be sold out the night of.	None	What?! It definitely was not that much last year. I think I paid $40 and that included sparkling wine at midnight.  Edit: Yup, bad faith on your behalf if you made up that number! Cost me $30 last year plus $2 sales tax.	0
fcmgz90	Had to crosspost this in here as it totally fits Boulder.	I don't think most people who have lists of their peeves hate Boulder.  Rather, I think most residents absolutely love some aspects of Boulder like the pretty views/great hiking/friendly culture.  But it's hard not to be troubled or concerned about some of the obvious warts of the city which seem like they're never going to change, like the unaffordability and the rapidly increasing homeless population.	 I don't understand why people who loathe Boulder so much continue to live in Boulder. That in and of itself is a tired trope.

People are dying without health insurance and you're trying to say that should continue because a few people might need to look for new jobs. Total bullshit from a histrionic liar.	Yeah, fuck the janitors and receptionists working minimum wage at Kaiser, how could they do such a thing?  The IT people that keep up Blue Cross' infrastructure? Worse than the devil, but clearly not as bad as the mail clerks.  Oh, and the people who work in doctors' offices that deal with the insurance companies?  Yeah fuck them for trying to support their families.  The nerve of them.  At a minimum, hundreds of thousands of people would be out of work. No sympathy for people who are trying their best?

Jesus, it's like people are blind to quality when they look at old graphics. The responses to this thread are depressing and probably a good explanation as any as to why 2K was allowed to put out their garbage for so long. I'm not saying this is *King of Colosseum* or something, but it's a quality game with amazing animation for the time it came out.	If it's a game from the early and mid 90s that's fine.

"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."   The first thing tyrannical governments to do in history is  stop communities from organizing (limit speech) the second thing they do it's remove arms from the people.

fhcbhmx	Tfw when he says it like it’s a good thing	&gt;It created courts that existed outside the legal sovereignty of signee nations that could effectively control their fiscal policy via lawsuits headed by companies looking to enter the market in that country. Basically a legal mechanism for imperialism.  It contained ISDS mechanisms, as does every trade agreement. However, that doesn't mean that corporations could control fiscal policy.   How exactly do you propose to solve international legal disputes if not with international courts? Do we simply cross our fingers and hope no nation ever breaches the agreement?	It created courts that existed outside the legal sovereignty of signee nations that could effectively control their fiscal policy via lawsuits headed by companies looking to enter the market in that country. Basically a legal mechanism for imperialism.	I really don't understand why the TPP was so unpopular. Just because of Protectionism?	The problem with them is that they're a tool in which companies can sue corrupt or ineffective governments in order to achieve what they want whether that's reducing pensions, keeping wages relatively low, skirting regulations, etc. and, most critically, it only goes one way. For example a country couldn't sue, say, Exxon in an ISDS if Exxon was responsible for an oil spill, but Exxon could sue that country in an ISDS if that country wanted to regulate how much oil could be extracted from it's territory. It's a totally biased agreement from the getgo pitting oftentimes small countries with corrupt local governments and judiciaries against massive billion dollar MNCs.    A better solution would be to work with these countries where an ISDS would be effective to reform their local governments and judiciaries and remove the corruption so that disputes can be resolved locally through the courts of the country where the disputes take place. I wouldn't be opposed to utilizing carrot/stick measures such as conditioning an absence of ISDS statutes on anti-corruption and judicial reforms such that if a signee nation wishes to settle disputes with MNCs in their own courts then they must undertake actual reforms otherwise they are stuck with an ISDS. Obviously that's a much harder task than don't creating another mechanism outside of that country, but that's how I would approach the issue.	0

finouyq	How does the IDW feel about "white fragility"?	I imagine you're thinking of Peggy McIntosh, who popularized the idea of white privilege in 1989 with her essay "White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack." (She didn't create it, technically, but it wasn't common parlance until her essay.) And you're spot on: She was an affluent woman, not scientific in the least, and wrote such a beautiful, persuasive essay that the term became not only common, but assumed to be true.   To her credit, her entire essay is written in first person, and it is about how she believes her own whiteness has given her an edge; I'm fairly certain she doesn't switch to second person pronouns at any point in it. (I used to teach it, so I have read and discussed it more than your average bear.) But it is disingenuous, to say the least, for her to overlook the most obvious factor for her "success" of all: she started with a silver spoon up her butt, protected, and was able to score a very good education thanks in large part to her family's affluence. She seemed blind to poor white trash like me, as well as people of color who have made it (such as Asians, who when actually oppressed in America--such as having to pay higher taxes during the California gold rush, somehow managed to succeed even harder; the same can be said for Jews, and you can't tell me they haven't been oppressed since forever, pretty much everywhere). Considering all, McIntosh had some massive, self-serving blind spots indeed.	What's her name, the woman who came up with the concept was just good old fashioned provaledged due to money and family connections. White provaledged was a way of explaining her cushy coast through life without having to address the elephant sitting in her lap.	I am no longer persuaded that there is such a thing as white privilege, even. It's a term that's vaguely defined and malleable, thus making it handy to apply to any situation whatsoever as a one-size-fits-all explanation for why one person lost out to someone else.   The definition of "racism" is the same as its ever been, but a lot of folks on the left have become persuaded that something cannot be racism unless it is concurrent with power. It's a convenient redefinition that, along with the notion that white people are all colonialist oppressors, means someone of that mindset can say nasty things about white people (for being white, specifically connecting things to that "race") and believe they cannot possibly be racist themselves. It's all bullshit, of course. Racism is racism like it always was. It's that definition / understanding itself that needs to be shown to be stupid until it dies.	None	0
fivsie2	People are annoyed with the proliferation of -isms and classes of victims, yet we really are all victims. Plus, to belittle another's suffering is to say that you have suffered more.	That's why I like antinatalism.  It's egalitarian. Everyone suffers.  That's it.  No need to rank it.  No need to point out that some people live through Hell.  No need to ignore problems because they're not as bad.	I don't think everyone's suffered the same amount though, everyone suffers to some extent, but to claim to have suffered the sum of someone else whose struggled with more is also belittling them.

You tax enough to break even and put the gravy in a fund for rainy days (basically what Norway did).  Had they done this they would not be in this predicament now.	Sure, but I do not think that is what most Albertans want. Please grant me the fact that I am making these comments as someone who has never stepped foot in Alberta, but have met plenty and do have some sympathies for their situation.  What it seems to me the average Albertans wants is low taxes, small but  strong government, oil subsidization and development, and the freedom to live their lives unencumbered by the federal government as much as possible.   They don't want a giant budget surplus. They want that money left in the pockets of Albertans.	None	Billions of that oil money has and is used to run Canada. If that money wasn't taken out of Alberta (since it's just gravy) then there wouldn't be this problem.

flewbaz	What Representing Men in Divorce Taught Me About Fatherhood	This is one of the best comments I've seen on this site in a long time.	There are always going to be people that are left out of the solution, because perfect solutions dont really exist. We could add 'except in cases of rape or domestic abuse', but would that increase the number of false claims on that? We could allow for governmental notification, but would that remove enough risk from the subset of women that are victims?  Ultimately, every solution comes with trade offs. What needs to be acknowledged is that men and women should come to that table as equals, with equal rights and equal opportunities to be involved in the lives of their children. Limitations on those rights should be based wholly on the actions of parents.  I am all in favor of a discussion on how to protect the safety of abused women *while* implementing changes to ensure equal parental treatment. I am rather against having that discussion *instead of* implementing those changes. We cannot be an egalitarian society whilst tolerating unequal treatment.	I take issue with the conflation of biological fathers with "real" fathers. Biology is not the be-all and end-all of family. And she presents the notion of a mother concealing her pregnancy from the father as a problem, but if a mother is legally obligated to reveal her pregnancy, that means some women will be forced to come into contact with their rapists and abusers out of concern for the father's parental rights.  There has to be a way to support fathers without putting women in danger.	None	0

fm3zjp0	Made-in-Canada ventilators, masks, test kits coming soon: Trudeau	What would also be amazing is that when times are good/normal people would complain it’s wasteful and demand it be shut or scaled down so their taxes could be lowered. ;-)	Wouldn't be amazing if we had crown corporations that guaranteed production of medical equipment and drugs at a low price during times like this? I guess I always have to dream.	None	Do not confuse the neoliberal strategies of privatization and starve-the-beast with "normal people complaining about taxes". This was a deliberate, directed, decades-long attack on public institutions to enrich the few, using "lower middle class taxes" as empty rhetoric and convincing us "normal people" to go along with it.	0

fm8bdq4	Despite coronavirus pandemic, farmers (US) plan to plant a record corn crop: 'Spooked by the China-U.S. trade war, American farmers say they will plant so much corn that production could near 16 billion bushels for the first time. “We’ll be swimming in corn,” said economist Todd Hubbs.'	What? Did you forget about the heaping pile of mortgage-backed securities tanking the economy?	Isn't this what ultimately started the 2009 recession? Overproduction of corn. Edit: I was in school when this happened, and I distinctly remember the very first sign that something was amiss, was some ethanol thing happening. I don't remember the details, but it was a bit before the housing crash. Edit 2: https://uneasymoney.com/2014/02/07/now-we-know-ethanol-caused-the-2008-financial-crisis-and-the-little-depression/	Is this uplifting news? I almost feel as though it's ominous news.  Plenty of crop to feed everyone is good, but overproducing can wreak havoc on an already fragile economy. The article makes it sound like the agriculture sector could be setting itself up for a fall with too much corn.  Cheap corn is good for us but could really hurt the farmers.  We need the farmers to do well, and the fewer government subsidy they need the better.	No, but before that what happened was ethanol kicked off a huge increase in price of food: https://uneasymoney.com/2014/02/07/now-we-know-ethanol-caused-the-2008-financial-crisis-and-the-little-depression/  I'm not crazy here, it was a thing I distinctly remember, was studying environmental science and geography at the time and had to read a ton of articles.	0

fmt8mu6	My narcissistic father shot and killed me	It's unfortunate you called it an accident, and that the charges were dropped. Because that's not the truth. He INTENDED to kill someone, you got in the crossfire. His discharge was "accidental", but it was due to negligent handling. Reckless discharge.  IN FACT, he broke the first rule of gun use: only aim a gun at something you intend to kill...and let's face it, you were an intended target, just not at the moment of the discharge of the fire arm.  Get out ASAP. AND if you're so inclined, sue him into the ground in Civil Court.	He was charged with assault with a deadly weapon and had a $10k bond. My uncle paid 1k and he was released from jail. Once police got a testimony from me and I verified it was an accident, the charge was dropped and money was refunded to uncle.	Um....was he not charged with something? Attempted manslaughter? How is he not in jail?  Agree with the above posts. Quietly find a way to get out and gtfo of there.	None	0
fo5rh3j	Can I be left leaning and be a part of this?	Acknowledged. I didn't mean to suggest that conservatives are free of sin. That doesn't make the left's sins okay, though. It don't work that way.	nothing says extremism like protesting with rifles and wearing MAGA hats just to eat at Baskin Robbins or to get a haircut hahaha. Give me a break here.	I get your title question on a visceral level. I'm curious about what "this" you mean you can't be a part of, though.   For me, it's irrational anti-Trump everything (if Trump did it or was involved or could be linked to it, it's evil by definition). It's the constant outrage, the extremism, the increasing requirement for ideological purity. It's the labeling and no-platforming, polarization and condoning violence and force. The inability to hear the other side in the same way my family's religion prevents them from truly hearing any point of view that isn't theirs, so I guess I mean that it's the fundamentalism of the movement that I find fucking frightening now. The language control. The apparent inability to see the big picture.   More and more, I ask myself whether I can support where I see this going and whether Trump is really that damn bad that I'd vote for what I see the left becoming just to get Trump out of office. I don't have an answer even for myself.	Eh lesser of two evils. Right now conservatives are underplaying COVID, telling us it was just the flu, Trump making openly authoritarian statements...i mean I could go on.   I am just not convinced the left has done so much harm that warrants my viewpoints making a 180. I got my problems with the left as well, however.	0

Thanks for this. I haven't read Scott Alexander in a long time and it was well worth my morning to read through these. I'm one of those atheists who used to be trapped in the "objective reality is the only thing that matters" mindset who since came around to embracing the concepts of god(s) as symbolically important if not indispensable to us as a species, although I'm not adept at explaining why.

Looked it up just to be sure, and yeah (from diffens dot com, the first explanation Google burped up):  &gt;**Equality** generally refers to equal opportunity and the same levels of support for all segments of society. **Equity** goes a step further and refers offering varying levels of support depending upon need to achieve greater fairness of outcomes.  "Need to achieve greater fairness of outcomes" to me means "achieve equal outcomes."	Since I didn't see it in the other comments, this type of thinking tends to go hand in hand with people who are interested (intentionally or unintentionally) in flattening hierarchies.  Imo, the reasoning emerges from a heavy handed belief in equality of outcome.	None	Greater equity is right.

fqbc6il	"You're entertained, but I'M informed"	That's not even remotely what the Fairness Doctrine was.  It wasn't some fucking panacea of unbiasedness it just meant you had to present multiple viewpoints on specifically controversial issues. Things like climate change would quality where 1 scientist + 1 skeptic would meet the criteria which makes both sides look like they have equal validity, which isn't even remotely the case.	Because we grew recognizing scrutinizing everything we saw on the net.  How many times did you see a link and thought "If I click that will I get a virus or rick rolled?"  We translated that skepticism to real life.    Meanwhile Boomers grew up in an era where the TV news had to unbiased (Fairness Doctrine) and they could trust everything they heard.  But then when the Fairness Doctrine was repealed and conservative talk radio and Fox News came around they treated everything they said as gospel.  Not to mention those outlets preyed on their confirmation biases and their insecurities of the changing world around them.	Fox News did to our parents what they thought video games would do to us.	Right, the difference is there was only a few networks which all had to appeal to a broad audience. Now we can have micro networks that appeals very specific frames of mind.	0

ft4fktp	Jesus	Same. I see Jesus as the man (a very 'good' one), and "Christ" as the divinity which came over him. I'm shit at remembering specific verses, but I have read lines in the Bible which almost literally suggest that the Christ was "in" Jesus, or Jesus was "in" the Christ. Almost like "Jesus" is a man, and when he was operating in an enlightened state he was "Christed" and thus called "Jesus Christ". Like a descriptive title, as opposed to Christ being like a last name, as I think many people assume.	Im of the same opinion , just a normal man but allowed all the sublime divinity, the power of the spirit to flow through him with no blockages which enabled him to heal etc	I don't think he was a higher being.  I think he was just a guy who accepted himself deeply and told things like they were.  This upset the establishment because the establishment is founded upon lies.  So, they killed him.  And yes, his message was totally corrupted by the Christians, that's true.  I personally like him because he was willing to die for what he knew to be good and true.  That's courage.  I think he was also more of a trouble maker than someone like Buddha, more of a rebel.  But I don't think he was totally unique in any way and I think there have been many like him albeit less well-known.	Kind makes sense with the whole christ conciousness being inside of us	0

ft52b7k	Ask me spiritual questions	Ooh good question.	What if you don't feel motivated to seek happiness for your self	None	Q: What if you don't feel motivated to seek happiness for your self  A: Do you need to be motivated in order to get happiness?   The answer would be ¨yes¨ if you have an idea of happiness. But does an idea of happiness result in happiness? Your idea of happiness will result in happiness when the idea gets fulfilled. Be aware that this happiness will only last for a certain amount of time.   The answer would be ¨no¨ if your idea of happiness will not get fulfilled.   But because you don't feel motivated to seek happiness for yourself I suppose that if you have an idea of happiness, that this idea will not get fulfilled.   So let's suppose that you would let go of your idea of happiness and the idea that you should feel motivated to seek happiness for yourself. Now you are able to find happiness in everything because there is no idea of happiness that needs to be fulfilled in order to be happy. But of course you can't find happiness in everything there possibly is. But you can't experience everything there possibly is, and because of this your world is created by what you experience. And what and how you experience things depends on your perspective. So if you still didn't find happiness, you have to change your perspective.  Thank you. 	0

fushdda	CMV: Calling people who aren't trans "cis" is perfectly fine.	I think this is a wrong comparison. Red and green apples are more like cousins. Perhaps a more fitting example would be "cat". Most cats have hair, so you only need to describe a Siamese as a "hairless cat" as it is the exception to the rule. Just to be clear, I don't mean that "cis" is better or worse than "trans", but it is the assumed default. Most people wouldn't need to say "I saw a cat with hair" in order for you to imagine a random "standard" cat, but they *would* need to say "I saw a hairless cat" to inform you that actually, that specific cat differed from most in that it had no hair. Does this make sense? Sorry, English is not my first language and I feel I am lacking the words to explain it.	Because that's how adjectives work. I addressed it in the post.   Apples for example are usually red, there are green apples. Is it a mistake to write on top of a shelf of apples that are red "red apples"?	This will be so short that it will get deleted, n but I just don't understand why extra terminology is needed to describe people who make up the great majority of the "normal" group. If terms are used to describe those outside the norm, it is safe to assume they don't apply to the rest.	Yes, thanks. This is what I was talking about.	0

fvalvvt	Senate just passed the Great American Outdoors Act allocating billions to National Parks and public lands.	There’s no obvious catch. Public lands are popular with the vast majority of Americans, and is relatively uncontroversial. There isn’t as much money involved in exploring public lands in the US as you might think.  It’s important however, to think about why this bill was even considered by the Republicans.  Two vulnerable incumbent Republican senators are up for re-election in November, and they happen to represent states where public lands are generally popular and a common topic of public debate.  You also have to think about how conservatives use conservation as a bargaining chip. Often they will let Democrats win big on this issue (at least from the Dems perspective), and get a small concession in return. These concessions, loosened regulations and extra mineral rights here and there, can add up. What you have to realize is that often these bills mostly protect areas that companies will never exploit, either because it’s too rugged, it’s bad PR (imagine mining Yosemite), or because it’s cheaper to extract the same resource from a third-world country.   If one day it makes a lot of sense to begin mass resource extraction in the US again, the Republicans can point to these concessions as precedent to exploit anywhere that isn’t a national park or wilderness area.  That’s the main catch. Let the Dems have their LWCF, wilderness areas, and national parks. We’re not really interested in exploiting those areas anyways. Let’s set a precedent for messing with XYZ area that the Dems aren’t paying attention to, so in case we need to drill there (or somewhere else), we can show that this area is already being exploited.	Seriously.	There’s gotta be a catch	I do believe there is currently a big push to frack public lands.  Its been a while since I left the industry though so perhaps I'm wrong..	0

Anything I have heard from the Conservatives in the past 15 years has been lower taxes and more law &amp; order. Lately it's been "we're not the Liberals"...  They are pathetically out of touch, especially on social issues.	The Tories need a leader. Bad. I have read some articles that indicate that the absence of a leader can provide a bump for the party because people envision their ideal candidate as the leader, but I really dont think that is the case here. They are rudderless right now and it shows. Trudeau is eating their lunch. The Bloc and NPD are pretty stable. It's the Tories who are bleeding votes to the Grits right now. Crazy. But also pointless as the odds of an election in 2020 are low. Not impossible. But low.	All’s quiet on the political front. Although with the Cornavirus quieting down and the Conservative leadership race getting some attention, we could see a little bit of movement.   It is not really shown in this poll, but I did notice with 338 Canada that the Liberal numbers were declining, slightly, for a couple of weeks. Whether this is just a blimp or a return to numbers more resembling last number I can’t say.

fw6gsut	House unanimously passes bill to designate Pulse Nightclub as national memorial	Yeah, if we want to compare this to confederate and slave owner/trader statues, it would be like erecting a statue of the terrorist who committed the crime and remembering/honoring him instead of remembering the victims.

fwiu9ix	Bill Gates said, "I will always choose a lazy person to do a difficult job because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it." What's a real-life example of this?	I wonder why we math'd differently.  I figured after 8640 total trips the labour has 'paid' for itself.	Assuming an 8 hour work day, you'd need to walk through that more than 120000 to save the 10 second effort.  Or if you split the time between the 14 of you who worked on it, then over 8000 times each.  That's 57 years at 150 times per year, each.  Edit: yes I know, it's not all about the time saved by the individual or even the group who did the work.  Good on OP for making an improvement to the world to the benefit of many	Back in highschool a lot of kids used to walk thru his park to get home/to school. A portion of the path went into the woods because it was just quicker than walking the actual trail.  At one point in the walk through the woods,  you had to go up this small but tedious hill; nothing major but it took like 10 seconds of hard work to go up it.  You couldn’t go around because one side was a small cliff to the creek below and other side had dense trees.  One summer, a bunch of us got together and decided to just dig through that hill to make it flat.  It took like 14 of us 3 good days to get through it.    It was a hard 3 days but it was definitely worth it. Saved 10 second of hill climbing every morning and afternoon, 150+ days of the year. And it wasn’t just us, but hundreds of other kids who took the same party every day. Sometimes you need to put in a lot of work so your future selves can enjoy the easy way out.	Yeah, I think I rounded fairly roughly.  8 hour days was a big assumption to make anyway	0

fy7ypf2	Kroger, the largest supermarket chain in the U.S., says all customers will be required to wear masks from July 22	I didn't realize there were still grocery stores that were not requiring masks at all locations. Holy shit.	What saddens me about the new store policies (Kroger is just the latest) is that it's probably going to be the floor employees who will have to enforce them. Those employees are the ones who will have to contend with the belligerent "customers" who refuse to comply. And they'll have to be nice/diplomatic about it, too -- can't just tell potential "customers" to "mask up or GTFO".  These folks need a raise (along with our first responders, of course).	None	None	0
fyp60u0	Oxford University's coronavirus vaccine with AstraZeneca shows positive immune response in early trial	Anyone who gets corona after refusing to take the vaccine should be the last to receive treatment.	The downer here is that a large number of people in the USA still wont get it.  Took our daughter in for her 3 year checkup last week, and the doc asked *if there was a vaccine, would we give it to her*. Obviously!  Protect my child from lung-scarring, blood-clotting, life-altering virus, amirite?  We were in the minority.  He said 80% of parents he had asked said they would not vaccinate their kid against COVID.	I am not smart enough to play downer here. can someone else tell me why i shouldnt be excited and this isnt actually good news  EDIT: Thank you all for the info. Seems to be summed up like this - its a step in the right direction and very encouraging. US users could be forced to pay large amounts for the vaccine. long term effects are unknown.

You should also read OP said "buying at the age of 18", it is 21 in America, so OP isn't even American... Also the United States is the #48 country in the "List of countries by alcohol consumption per capita".

g00vegk	You can only "be yourself" in public if "yourself" is socially acceptable.	That dumb shit that's always on insta and Facebook quoting "Japanese culture". It's somewhat believes, but the origins for its English version is the fact that there's traditionally three ways to name important people (other than referring to them by their title). 1) their family name, for the world. 2) their given/"first" name for close friends. 3) their actual, priest-ordained personal name that's only told to parents &amp; wife &amp; other very trusted family.  (They had a separate personal name to protect themselves from curses, and it's not really a thing that's done in modern times)	I read a while ago that everyone has 3 faces, 1 they show the world, 1 they show people close to them, and 1 they only show themselves	I think people are really complex beings and there's no such thing as a "true self". There are many things that dictate how our genuine reaction will be, so there are many ways you can be yourself.  When someone tells you to be yourself, they probably mean "don't try to much to be someone you're not", so the play is to be your best self for the occasion instead of just being brutally honest about everything	I saw someone else comment it on reddit. Still holds some truth though, either way	0

g1024li	CMV: It is not unfair to expect your SO to (at least attempt to) maintain some form of physical attractiveness throughout the relationship.	He shouldn't, and John's ex (who it seems as an object without a personality of her own does not deserve a name) should be happy she dodged a bullet.	In sickness and in health would apply wholeheartedly to a healthy relationship, yes. But falling sick vs making yourself sick are too different things. Johns SO chose, whether consciously or subconsciously, to change to an unhealthy lifestyle which negatively affected Johns chemistry with her. Love isnt set for life, its a constantly evolving entity. He had no control over his loss of attraction to her, but she *did* have control over her lifestyle choices. He then communicated his feelings, giving her a chance to fight for their love, and she couldnt follow through. Why then should he be obliged to stay in such an unhappy and unbalanced relationship because our society is obsessed with Christian romanticism and the idea of soul-mates?	This one is simple, in sickness and in health.  Be it physical obesity or mental illness that causes it you both make a commitment.  In this example John had different expectations than the commitment he signed on for.  If that's the case then his problem is not with her, he made a mistake about the level he committed to.	If a man with standards of physical attractiveness is a bullet this woman is about to Enter the Gungeon	0

I found it funny how OP used the words “hard work”, “winning over John” and “get the guy” to describe the girl’s efforts to maintain her physique. Makes it sound like “John” is some type of fitness god who can do no wrong and has hundreds of women lining up outside his door to be his SO.	Right, it sounds like he ALSO believes it. If it isn't the same dude magically I bet his girlfriend is terrified I've gaining weight now, and most likely won't get pregnant with him	0
g1cgykk	What do you tell a friend who doesn't believe in therapy?	Jesus, where do you live that you even have to think about something like that?!?!?!	As a former non-believer:  It's not a matter of not believing in therapy, it's denial that there is a problem to begin with. Admitting therapy works is the first step down a slippery slope that ends with admitting you have a problem. In some industries, having one of those kinds of problems is the fastest way to end your career.  If this is the case, a system removed from the industry is the answer. Some states and industries have an Employee Assistance Program that is 2 or 3 times removed from your employer. Most of the time they only do crisis management, but it only takes one appointment for them to shift you over to long term support if that's what you need. And it cannot ever legally get back to your employer that you even called the number to begin with.	None	Less geographical and more being in the military. Admitting to having to having any sort of mental issue, especially PTSD, still kills careers. Even though the official stance says otherwise.  "We're here to help" usually means they will help you right out the door. If everything works out with the VA you can sometimes get a priority hire somewhere else but it doesn't always work out.	0

Also the fact that very little needed to achieve it was actually difficult, much like OSRS in general, it just took hundreds of hours. People aren’t realising that when others say “Dude 1% was easy” it’s coming from the people who played for hundreds of hours within the space of a couple of months.

Reddit:  Dude, you must check out r/RaisedbyNarcissists	My GF made herself a sandwich and didn't ask if I wanted one.   Reddit: she's a sociopath, this is classic abuser behavior and you need to get out NOW.	"Red flag, break up with them". Or when you someone writes a paragraph of text and then commenters psychoanalyse it and know nothing, absolutely nothing else about the OP, and then, to make it worse, other people then build on the original comment making further and further assumptions about OP.

g34qi40	They are evolving, just backwards.	It's the same thing that happened with people wanting "Gender-inclusive" bathrooms but being upset that men could go in there. The rational was really stupid too, in bars and restaurants, men's bathroom had shorter queue ('cause their business is faster generally), while women's bathroom had longer queue because business takes longer AND they tend to "freshen up" their make up and shit while in there.   So obviously it was sexist that men had faster queue, then you also got trans people who were upset that they couldn't go in the bathroom they identified as, hence gender-inclusive bathroom.	Guys, you have to understand. This isn't Jim Crow or segregation. They aren't asking for separate facilities for blacks and whites. They want one set of facilities only for black people and another set for everyone, including black people. Because allowing white people to have their own space is white supremacy.

You can't change the informed, intelligent adults mind so you start working on the kids young while they are still required to listen in order to pass a class.

We treat our teachers like crap and you say that's where the genuis' go?	Its so funny when conservatives complain about left-wing "bias" in universities. Gee, it's almost like the majority of the most intelligent, informed, educated people share the view that your politics are regressive and unworkable 	None	I'm talking about university professors, rather than teachers.

g44cx36	Remove revs from the cave and give them spawns all around the wilderness	\&gt; They had ridiculous attack ranges so you couldn’t even log if you saw one.  Yeah, that was the point.

Except PKers have to deal with them too by extension of them being there, also see again the point about actually making the wilderness dangerous.  \&gt;  It won’t even fix the current issue.   Actually, it very easily would. The current issue is dozens of players camping a group of profitable monsters in a small space. Spacing them out across the entirety of the wilderness means substantially more ground for them to cover, which would no longer be possible, and take them much longer to get reinforcements. Not to mention single-combat areas.	No. They had ridiculous attack ranges so you couldnt even log if you saw one. Their loot sucked. Absolutely not.   Then a pker comes by and youve wasted half of your food against your will. Stop trying to make this happen. It wont even fix the current issue.  Just remove the caves at this point.

g4akgnt	It's almost as if making such long-term and life altering decisions at a young age is a horrific mistake.	&gt; Why don't these parents just admit they wanted their child to be the opposite sex instead of pushing a harmful agenda?   No no no, you're close though. They don't want a child of the opposite sex, they want a trans children, to be lit, unique parents. Doesn't matter if the kid is a boy or a girl, they want it to be trans because then that means they'll be up there up on the SJW totem pole as "parents of a trans kid"	Why don't these parents just admit they wanted their child to be the opposite sex instead of pushing a harmful agenda?   My father made it very obvious he wanted a boy so he put me in a mixed soccer team sports since i was like 5 and that didn't make me trans or question my femininity. If anything it made me competitive as hell and it removed the mental barrier that  girls couldn't be better or just as good as boys. I also collected Chevron Cars and I was extremely proud of the collection I had, then when I was like 10 I started collecting Care Bears. Kids will want to play with anything that gets their attention be it shiny or colorful or loud and they'll want to play with something else the minute they see something new. That's how kids are.   Not to mention how much the toxic mentality that if "a girl likes boy toys or a boy likes girl toys they are 1000% trans" just pushes in favor of the gender sterotypes they "preach" about wanting to erase. Aaaand yeeet.... here we are...	None	None	0

Most people don't want to do a long quest for small rewards just for story reasons, so they won't vote in fun filler type quests, it needs to have some op training / BiS rewards.  Of course there are exception, like the new slayer quest incoming, but back in the days they made more quests in a year than osrs did in 7.

Grenier is averaging a lot of old polls here, and giving us an out-of-date view of public opinion as a result.

Its not free even if that's what Jagex wants to tell you. They originally said we'd be able to unlock more than half the regions, or 5/9 of them, which would be misthalin+4 choices. Karamja is a forced unlock.	0
g75sj9m	Unlisted TrailBlazer League trailer	They were always limiting you to picking 3 regions. Karamja is on top of that now.	3 region unlocks..? That's pretty offputting tbh, now they're forcing us to go Karamja because they want to see an infernal cape race, kinda weird imo, shouldn't "force" us to pick a region that most people wouldn't have unlocked anyways. Now if someone wants something like a blowpipe you have to spend 2/3 of your region unlocks on elf/desert for darts and only have 1 other region choice :/  /u/JagexFlippy /u/JagexHusky	None	None	0
g7gb82o	Ohio State University's woke student group gets mad at their school for reporting a black on white hate crime, which they're required to do under federal law	I blame the fall of tumblr. There is a direct correlation between the increase of normie tumblrina with the downfall of tumblr.	The real issue here is that this nonsense has escaped twitter and is now in the real world. Its one thing for some obese, multi-colored hair, gender whatever millennial to bitch and moan into the twitterverse, its another when it manifests itself in the real world.	Why are you surprised? It's just the logical follow-up to the whole "you can't be racist towards white people" shtick.	tumblr lost popularity with the porn ban, i wonder if these people all have a correlation with porn addiction.	0
g7rvmzw	"Perfection"; a play in three posts.	It might have been part of the counter-movement at the time?  I've never actually seen someone "flamboyantly" gay, but I've known quite a few gay people, and they're just, you know, themselves.  I think the flamboyant persona was the reaction to finally "coming out of the closet", both personally and socioculturally. I mean roughly 50 years ago was the turning point for gay people legally.	On that note, what's with the ultra flamboyant act for gay dudes? I am a gay dude myself, and have never understood it. I briefly deliberately acted like this when I first came out at 13-14 years of age because I thought gay men were supposed to act like this, but then grew out of it when I realised it wasn't me. But is it actually a part of some peoples' personalities?	None	I've seen many flamboyant gays and they are usually a treat to talk to. Like they are just pure chaos.	0
g7ynh5a	From the S.C.U.M. Manifesto by Valerie Solanis	Well this was written a long time ago by a pretty crazy woman suffering from paranoid schizophrenia.   Anyone quoting that is out of their mind, but I would take such text with a big grain of salt.	The ironic thing is these same people think men rule the world. So you're telling me you are being subdued by an inferior being? Classic case of trying to have your cake and eat it too	None	Sad fact is it's actually rather tame to what I see passes for a hot take   Also I didn't see her complaining when she basically got off with a slap in the wrist for attempted murder.  Warhol on the other hand suffered from ptsd for the rest of his life and was paranoid that she would murder him again.  A number of his loved ones said that he was never the same again and his previously playful gregarious personality was replaced by someone who trembled whenever anyone touched him.  Solanas is still seen as one of the greatest heroines of the feminist movement and a number of modern academics hold her in high esteem and ignore the attempted murder and the profound effect it had on his life and those who loved him.	0

gaoifyk	U.S. reports world record of more than 100,000 COVID-19 cases in single day	Wow imagine trying THIS HARD to spin this into something postive.	The positivity rate is still much lower than even just a couple of months ago.  The record number of cases every day is because we're doing *much* more testing than then.  Nearly every day is a new record for the number of tests done, which is why nearly every day is a new record for the number of cases, despite the positivity rate being lower than in August.  In order words, we're not actually doing worse than we were in August.  Deaths, hospitalizations, and positivity rate are all lower than in the summer.  We're testing more now.  Now, the positivity rate is still increasing, so who knows how high it'll get before it plateaus, and it *could* end up worse than the summer, but so far we're still doing better than the initial onslaught and still doing better than the summer wave.

At least it will be regulated. But then there's the legality of only allowing so much to be bought and so on. There will be a lot of legal wrangling and additional bureaucracy	Why not? Once you realize addiction becomes a medical issue and people need help, it doesn't make sense to entangle them in the legal system. No matter what the substance or drug it's still a medical issue.	What so ice and crack and everything??	I don't think they will ever regulate hard drugs. They are just not sending people directly to jail if they have small amounts and are clearly an addict. They offer them treatment instead.	0

gcqa7p1	So excited to start the Bandos grind on my HCIM! Oh wait... Instanced GWD, please	What if instances were available as an option for all players, including non-ironmen?	I don't understand how people say instancing GWD is catering ironmen. If they would have had the same chance at getting a drop as a normal account (if they dealt more damage than the normal account for instance) it would indeed be catering ironmen by giving them instances. However, getting a GWD kill is almost impossible as another account only has to hit the boss once in order to take the drop away from the ironman. Thus you can never "win" a crash attempt. The only solution now is to try and find another world and hope nobody comes in, or to give up and go do something else...	None	That definitely would be the most fair way in dealing with instances, yes. However I think this creates a problem a lot of people complain about, as killing a certain GWD boss would be way easier as you always have a free room. This results in an increase of items dropping which in turn devalues the unique items.	0

But what I’ve seen from him this far this year, it’s the exact opposite - everything I wanted to see from him in ‘18. Taking chances. Big throws downfield. I love what I’m seeing.	Hes playing well too.  Had a few encounters with Alex in KC and comes off as just another dad running errands on a Saturday.  Any club should be really happy with him being a part of it.  Dude deserves all the success after being robbed at a chance of it early in his career	He's taking WFT to the playoffs this year. Calling it now.	Once he builds confidence in his receivers and coaxhes, he opens up the passes.  You guys have some solid receivers for him, and before Hill he never really had them, just TEs.

Crying on instagram is giving them what they want and will only make things worse.	What does this even mean, it's no big deal? That it's common? or that the threats aren't dangerous? They're crying because it makes them feeling a certain way. Is your opinion about the way they should feel?	Yeah I don’t like the idea of attention seeking and crying for a 10 minute video, but this facade that celebrities aren’t human and don’t feel anything is ridiculous.

gdrdun6	[NFL Research] Alex Smith is now 8-5 in his career as a Washington starter. Since HOF Joe Gibbs retired in 2008, Smith is the only Washington QB who has a winning record.	What? They were *not* playing well. You guys stomped us, NO absolutely murdered us, and we had a negative point differential despite having the third easiest strength of schedule through those nine games. We simply lucked into some close wins, despite literally bottom-5 play by Smith, and I don’t really know what would’ve happened if he hadn’t gotten injured. None of our subsequent losses were particularly close aside from the Titans game, so maybe we go 8-8? Hard to see Smith’s average of 200 yards and a TD per game being the difference maker in any of the other losses.   I love Alex and I’m glad to see him back out there, but having watched all those games, that was the worst 6-3 team I’ve ever seen.	Yeah I had forgotten how well they were playing when that happened, it makes the injury even worse	Washington would have made the playoffs in 2018 were it not for that horrifying injury. Would they have gotten far? Probably not. But it would have been different.	I wasn't watching super close or anything but I'm just saying they were well into the playoff hunt, you obviously know more that I do tho so I defer lol	0

One thing I never liked about takes like this are that they're criticizing a player for using their teammates' strengths. Isn't that what they're supposed to do? Why should a RB get criticized for properly utilizing his good offensive line? Why should a QB get criticized for properly utilizing good receivers?

Our generation thinks theyre the first to do anything, including caring about anything, and we woefully resent the idea that anything happened before we were here and refuse to acknowledge that any of it was good or effective. Its like our elementary school teachers told us how important we were and we just believed it without even trying to figure out what thats supposed to mean, what our duty is or how we could fulfill it. Wed rather concentrate on staying angry 40% of the day and then distract ourselves as fully as we can with entertainment for the other 60%.	It's funny to me as a millenial as I remember people my age saying the exact same thing.

ger0cqb	(Required)	It helps to explain why someone is "completely 100% wrong", otherwise I could just say "This is actually completely 100% wrong" and we'd end up nowhere.	That is actually completely 100% wrong	Very ironic that she is accusing her of cognitive dissonance and doesnt even know what cognitive dissonance is.    Cognitive dissonance is saying one thing but acting in a completely opposite way. For example, preaching about body positivity whilst shaming anyone for trying to improve their health  Cognitive dissonance =/= Stupidity or Ignorance	Ok. Well cognitive dissonance is a strong belief in something, so strong in fact that when you are provided with evidence that you are wrong you refuse to believe the new found evidence or viewpoint. Often the person will double down or start throwing accusations of conspiracy or blaming untrustworthy sources. Instead of accepting they're wrong they just do everything in their power to deny the very idea that they could be incorrect.	0

Why they want to be with someone who is willing to just up and leave their partner for a new person is baffling.	I don't know that it actually counts as an insult, but I once had to deal with this asshole who repeatedly told my girlfriend that he was in love with her and she should leave me for him.

gfx9zz0	Google extends work from home till September 2021, considers hybrid workforce model	This is exactly right. The guidance at these companies has always been:  1. We know WFH is tough for a lot of people and will make offices available to those that want them ASAP. 2. But you can plan your life knowing you're allowed to be fully remote until &lt;some date&gt;.  The public always interprets that as the company predicting the exact date when it'll be safe again but that's really not what's going on. At Google, for example, some of their non-US offices are already open for employees who choose to go back in.	I think the reason companies are giving specific dates is as a way to tell their employees that they don't need to worry about being back in the office before that date even if it is safe before then  These aren't "we are sure it will safe by this date" dates, they're "you're safe to plan knowing that you can work from home until this date no matter what" dates  "Whenever the majority of the population has taken the vaccine" is more vague and harder to plan for as an employee	My company simply said that the office will be shut until a vaccine is broadly available and a majority of the population has taken it. There is no point speculating on a "safe" opening date otherwise. It has already moved from June 2020 to November 2020 to July 2021 to now September 2021 for all the tech companies.	Google had a majority of their global office open over the summer. Something like 42/49 countries	0

gglxw36	Discussion Thread	I wonder if this might have some unintended consequences for healthcare funding? In my country, free access to mental healthcare services is available only if you are diagnosed with a recognized mental disorder. Presumably now we either have to carve out an exception for trans people, or just hope they happen to have some other mental disorder? The tricky part about the 2nd part is I'm not sure you could ask for a therapist that specializes in trans issues if you're just going for treatment for depression, rather than gender dysphoria.	!ping LGBT  In response to some discussion yesterday, I think it's worth reminding people how the ICD-11 treats being transgender.  The ICD-11 is scrapping the diagnoses for "transsexualism" and "gender identity disorder" with a diagnosis for "gender incongruence", which does not require distress related to gender and is not classified as a mental disorder.

gh9spcc	Huh?	Some dumb ass Trumper on my brother's Facebook tried blaming Pelosi for the shit $600 compromise.  I quickly put his ass in check, and the best part was that I used current news articles to do so.  I posted articles about how Dems immediately jumped on Trump's proposal to give $2,000 immediate aid to people, and that it was the GOP that were blocking it.  He tried to weasel his way out of it and pull a "everything's just so fucked up" non-answer.  But my primary point being that Pelosi isn't to blame is something that he had no counter for.  We keep trying to fight propaganda with facts.  And it's never going to work.  American conservatives are just truly dishonest, malignant assholes.  Their leaders aren't stupid, they're evil.	Trumpers/bots are pushing the idea that $600 checks were Democrats idea and doing.  They also use the fact that about 50 Republicans in the House voted against the bill, yet choose to leave out the fact that those Republicans (and most others) did not want to support giving out any assistance whatsoever.  The $600 was compromise to send out assistance now instead of waiting longer.  Trump just threw this wrench out for the $2000 checks, and now the right is championing him as the only one fighting for the people.

ghep7zl	Why do so many people think we’re evil?	Well it's not about hatred, and it's not about wanting the world to end, that will be the VHEMT, _voluntary extinction movement_, AN is a very ancient philosophy being resurrected now, some of its proponents wrote in volumes in classical literature.  It is about assigning a negative value to birth, AN considers a life worth living once it has started, if you could find some transhumanist way of avoiding all life's terrible negatives, and that you can guarantee that no future mishaps will befall any helpless human, then I believe many ANs will be okay with it.	You literally want humanity to end. Such obvious hatred for life makes it hard not to see you as evil.	None	First of all, you sure have to hate humanity to think that a birth has a "negative value". You don't have to have children, but think of your friends, your family. Do you think their birth has a negative value? Would they be better off i they didn't exist?  By the way, if you want people to stop having children, humanity will die out. If you really don't hate humanity, you would see the value in birth, since it keeps humanity alive.  But its worse than just not seing the worth of humanity. You also have to bring everyone else to your level, to make sure that noone sees the value of humanity.   I want to believe that there are good people here, but your way of seing life is sick and twisted.	0

ghmd42d	Good, old fashioned racism	As a former racist, let me take a shot at this:  **Insecurity**   I once truly believed that "every white woman" just wanted to run off with a black man.  And it made me a bitter, angry person.  It wasn't the sole cause of my racism, but rather a trait that I picked up as I became racist in general.  And when pop culture feeds you tropes like *"Once you go black, you never go back";* and Dave Chappelle plays up white men as "bitches" on his show, it adds fuel to the fire.  *Your perception alters your reality.*  Because I was basically an incel at that point in my life, I was bitter and angry. Of course, I also had a very warped view of sexuality, that was fueled by the internet.  Not explicitly porn, but thinking that internet personalities and message boards were an accurate representation of most people.  Basically, I thought that the real world operated based off of racial fetishization.  Once I became more confident and started dating more, starting having more of a social life, started becoming more confident as a lover, etc. that was one stepping stone that broke down my racism.  Or having a few classes, and becoming very good acquaintances with a few white women who dated black men, and I realized that they weren't just "ignorant hoes who wanted black dick".  They were human beings who just happened to be with people that they loved.    Also, could I deny that I was physically attracted to women of pretty much any ethnicity?  So why be a hypocrite?  Most racism is just repackaged insecurity and fear.  [Just like Frank Meeink said.](https://www.cracked.com/personal-experiences-1446-5-things-i-learned-as-neo-nazi.html)	Most women do try to date white men as they're usually the majority race around them, only to often find out that they're racist or have other bad personality traits.  On that note why do racist white men think they have so much competition of *minorities* when they make up 60% of the US (78% if you include Hispanics/Latinos) whereas black men make up 13%.	White fragility is an ugly thing.  Racist white men are terrified of non-racist white women, because they think it automatically means that they date black men.  It truly reveals their priorities, and just how they view women as possessions (which to be clear, is indeed a problem shared among all races and ethnicities.  But this particular example refers to white men).	None	0
gho673t	CMV: Female nudity in TV and films is almost always unnecessary and doesn’t serve any purpose beyond making light porn	I think the issue here is that most movies throw topless women at us, but we rarely see penises, and never an erect one (except in porn). I'd like to know why an erect penis is such a forbidden fruit? If a movie wants to show a guy is excited to have sex with the girl, it always shows him grabbing her and kissing her all over but never shows his dick. A woman's breasts will be shown with nipples hardened but the penis is absent. Isn't that weird?	Nudity is natural. So is sexuality. It's the society that somehow made these things into something "strange".  If the movie plot contains a relationship that may be sexual, then showing the actors in a sexual manner is just as natural as showing them having breakfast or driving to work. And if someone is taking a shower, then, well they wouldn't do it in clothes, would they?  So you might as well say that scenes involving breakfast and driving are only for food fetishists and car fanatics.  If anything, trying super hard to cover this - like couples sleeping under L-shaped blankets and women always wearing bras during sex - is more distracting to me.	None	I guess it is.  I dunno, I guess an erect penis is a sign of nothing else but PIV sex (unless we're talking medicinal context), while nudity has a lot different uses, and intimacy can also be explored in many different ways.  On the other hand, this inequality is sort of evened out by the other way, the aforementioned L-shaped blankets and bra sex.	0

We go to see movies to escape our reality, not continue it. Like, who TF wants to go see a movie where the wife is all sorry Ive been on my period for like 3 weeks but I promise tomorrow Ill have unenthusiastic and emotionally distant sex with you.

gho6ynp	CMV: Female nudity in TV and films is almost always unnecessary and doesn’t serve any purpose beyond making light porn	This is such a boring argument and so easy to dismiss.

If movies had no nudity or sexuality of any kind (from any gender) how would they be representative of humanity?  We are sexual beings and denying that would be the same as saying that people shouldn't be seen eating in movies.	None	Thats a good point. I'm all for it.	0
ghomi8w	Say it with me: It's better to regret not having kids than having kids	Your coworker spoke based on her present status of  _a mother_ when someone already has kids, most of their statements regarding the issue will be in favor of their own actions, her statement was convoluted, obviously.	I had a coworker try and tell me the opposite. She was a fellow bartender with like 4 kids and when I told her my wife and I never plan of having kids, she responded with "you might regret having kids but you will definitely regret not having them."    Don't get me wrong, she was a dope woman and probably my favorite coworker at that job. I just massively disagree with that statement at such a fundamental level. I just kind of shut down the conversation after that because unlike a lot of breeders I don't feel the need to shove my convictions down the throats of others. Since she already has a gaggle of kiddos, the damage is already done and so me getting into it with her accomplishes nothing.

ghonzoc	I don't think I can truly be happy in this world	People concentrating on sports and other trivial issues do surprise me too, it's like people purposely refuse to take up the _real_ issues that define our existence, I think it could be a form of defense mechanism, a way to make sure that Pollyanna/optimistic mindset is maintained.	Most people are, at best, not even mediocre in this garbage society. Try to initiate a deep, interesting conversation and they'll gaslight you and shut you down. They seem happy enough to talk about home renovation, property prices, sports, shopping, what junk food they will order in.	I agree.  Life really is just a game of cards with a deck stacked against you, and someone else took the liberty of gambling with your life. It’s hard to get far in life, unless you get lucky, and like most people I’m untalented and really just part of the cull. I’m probably a pathetic specimen, but I find it really discouraging to try to struggle to far far in life, since it will probably be for nothing in the end and there really is no safety net for you if you go out and try. And if you fail the world will only laugh at you.  Really, this world isn’t worth it. Not even close.	hmm well thats.. coming from a person.. i felt frustrated about.. the sports thing alot because. well maybe its the fitting in thing of those around ya.. and if ya cant in  or something.. its.. how does one describe that-- but its weird yea.. its like, why dont they reduce the salaries of higly paid athletes and put it into things that could improve the whole society in larger way.. insetad of just some people getting a HUGE sum of money for some (and they probably donate to charity yea some will say. but how much that in the grand scheme and people still live really bad yea [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElG5-nXD0B8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElG5-nXD0B8)) i dunno, play you could call it. we all selish on some level.. its the i want i want thing maybe.. so if we feel good individually and of those close around us..

gi6z22v	Helen Viola Jackson, the Last Known Surviving Widow of a Civil War Veteran, Dies at 101	I’m a Millennial in my late 30s and I remember as a kid in the 80s that most of the old folks I knew were born in the 1800s. My own grandparents were born in 1903 and 1910. The past is very much with us more than we realize.	Even considering the bizarre situation this still puts into perspective how the past really wasn't that long ago. People like to act like the Civil War and slavery were a totally different time, but some people alive today had parents and grandparents that were enslaved.	 Jackson was only 17 when she married James Bolin, a 93-year-old widower who served as a private in the 14th Missouri Cavalry through the end of the Civil War. Jackson, who was one of 10 children, helped care for Bolin and assisted him with daily chores after school, an arrangement that was made by Jackson’s father. After a period of time, Bolin asked for Jackson’s hand in marriage, as a way to provide for her future, [**according to the Missouri Cherry Blossom Festival**](https://www.cherryblossomfest.com/WordPress/?page_id=2246). 	I’m probably same age as you. Most of my grandparents died before I was born (they were born 1901, 1906, 1913, 1919), so my grandparents’ closest friend was my “grandpa”. He was born in 1889, served in WWI. Named after Teddy Roosevelt and got some letter from him after he was born, that he had hung up in his house. It blows me away that I knew someone who was born in the 1800s.	0

gj4rl15	What was the first JRPG you ever played and the most recent JRPG you played? What are the similarities?	One thing I find interesting in that juxtaposition is the role of a kind of *life force* or eminent energy, which recurs in several Final Fantasy games. In FFVII it's the Lifestream; in FFXII it's the Mist. Both games feature groups (Shinra, Cid's team) who are trying to manipulate the source of energy, with the results (Materia and Mako, magicite) being hotly contested in the game world.	Final Fantasy VII (first), Final Fantasy XII.  Both of these game's have two "II" in the title, which is amazing and makes them instantly appealing to me. Aside from that they are fairly different in most regards, even though they operate on the same spectrum. A study of the similarities between VII and XII would be really interesting but my mind is blanking out at the moment...	None	None	0
gj5afry	JRPG 101	This is a great question.   For reference, in an introductory survey class in literature, faculty might assign over 100 pages a week, and assume 1-2 hours out of class reading for every hour in class. So a really dedicated student might put in 6 hours of reading per week, in addition to assignments and attending class. In 16 weeks, that would be 96 hours.   If people expected students to play through each game, that would be about 5 games long, 2 games if any kind of completionism is involved, and 1 game for the people picking Persona.   It'd be better to approach the class in 1-2 week units where students play how much they can. Sometimes (like with Pokemon) it'd be important to start from the beginning and get a feel for the game progression. For longer titles like Xenoblade Chronicles, it might be desirable to sample sections of the game and frame discussions around those parts of the game.	*Play* or *Complete*?

About "rough looking people", not to make folks get irrationally scared about this stuff, but you should trust your gut if it's saying "don't camp by them, don't get on this elevator, don't get in this person's car." Safety experts will tell you that our instincts are pretty well attuned over thousands of years of evolution to really hone on very specific but indescribable and often illogical clues about something being off.	Less urban but sharing anyway  I was camping in BC with my gf at the time and her dog, had a couple of rough looking people who were the only other people in the area we were camping but it was late so we set up and thought nothing of it.  Guy wanders over while were in our tent (can hear him outside and dog is barking at this point) I get out and ask what hes doing and he says he just wanted to pet the dog (this is at like midnight) told him we were settling in etc, guy wanders off without replying at all to what Id said   Woke up the next morning to what looked to me like a single 9mm bullet sitting upright on our sites picnic table, and a happy face made with sticks and rocks on the bench part of the table below it.

gj9wzo7	Dragon Quest Creator Wants To Revolutionize NPC AI For The Series	I would want my team to act autonomously in many non-boss battles.  The AI for this sort of thing is pretty good, especially in combats that are not crucial. I certainly have a time and a place for "Follow Orders," but if I'm just getting to the next area and fighting a few enemies along the way, the AI is going to execute the same commands on a standard mob that I would. Having to always push "Attack" or do basic abilities myself is a timewaster.	I will never, ever, ever understand turn-based JRPGs where you don't control the whole party. Action RPGs and pseudo-action RPGs, sure, there's a reason for that. But if I'm pausing the combat to input commands anyway, why would I *ever* want 75% of my team to do random nonsense that doesn't fit into my battle strategy? I think they should save themselves the development cost and scrap the feature entirely.	None	That's fair, I hadn't considered that. Though, in that case, I would think a single-button "auto-battle" option seems more useful than having to dig through cumbersome menus to re-assign everyone's AI at the beginning and end of each zone. But I guess digging through cumbersome menus is one of the selling points of the series, lol.	0
gjb3x8v	Abortion Should Not Be Top Priority for Christians	Not good for the aborter(s) but for the abortee. Fast-track to heaven.  There have been Christians who murdered their own fully grown children for this very reason as a selfless act which actually makes perfect sense within Christian doctrine: you condemn yourself to hell so your kids get to go to heaven rather than walk the slippery tightrope of a life of thoughts and actions beyond the age of reason.	Yes but the whole point of Christianity is the after life so abortion is a good thing according to their messed up beliefs.	They would say that we made childbirth painful due to the "fall". Of course, the fall never happened because Adam and Eve never existed. But even metaphorically, an omnimax god would have foreseen the "fall" in making the universe to certain specs, could have altered those specs so it wouldn't have happened, but failed to do so, so it's 100% his will in this scenario.  In any meaningful conversation, the fetus stuff you described is irrelevant. Bodily autonomy is all that matters. You could probably twist some interpretation from the bible on bodily autonomy.	Precisely, good point.  Also if you read the old testament carefully, God murders around 400,000 children that are below 3.	0

gje1u10	Apart from accent, how can you tell someone is British?	An underrated comment!	Yeah you can tell who is Roman as well because when you give them two drinks they ask where the other three are.	When indicating the number two with their fingers, we (British) will always use the front (Palm side) of their hand rather than the back.  It's very offensive in the UK to use your two fingers while showing the back (like showing your middle finger); so growing up it became natural to use the palm side of your hand to indicate two, rather than the back. I think Americans call it the peace sign, or V sign. For us it means F\*\*k you.  When working in a pub I would always be able to tell who was foreign and who was British by the way they asked for 2 drinks with their hands.	None	0

gjehsgs	My aunt had a still birth, thank fuck!	I'm going to walk you through this slowly:  1) In this subreddit, birth is considered bad.  2) Not meanie bad. More like REALLY bad. We're talking at the level of murder and rape.  3) Therefore, when birth is prevented, it's like someone was rescued from a murderer or rapist.  4) No one extends condolences to a murderer or rapist who failed to follow through. Therefore, don't expect those who see birth as this REALLY bad thing to extend any sympathy to an individual who would have perpetuated that REALLY bad act.  You may not agree with this, and for that there is the back button.	Bro shes probably so upset wtf	None	But from my understanding, we’re here and childless because we see life as inescapable anguish. And we care so much about people not going through the suffering in life, hence being against it all. If that’s where you’re at, then I’m with you, I agree.   But if you can’t look at the anguish of those already in life and feel sympathy for their anguish, regardless of how YOU feel about the situation and whether you would feel the same pain, then you’re still the problem here. We have to care about each other while we’re here, not regress and enjoy the pain of your aunt. You can have bittersweet feelings, hate that there was ever going to be a niece or nephew coming into inevitable climate change or whatever it is you fear in our impending fate. But not consoling your aunt as she suffers through this regardless if you thinks she’s wrong or brainwashed is just as problematic.   And- to argue that having a child is just as bad as murder is dissonant within this logos. Murder would be a good thing right? Because that’s another life that doesn’t have to suffer? You can’t argue it’s as bad, because that isn’t the subjective feeling of most people anyway, in any culture. Including this particular internet subculture.   Tl;dr you can be compassionate to the loss and pain of those around you while still being philosophically opposed to natalism	0
gjfh84w	6 suspects in MI Governor Whitmer kidnapping plot set to stand trial in March	What do we do when one of them turns out to be highly articulate and charismatic? What do we do when they know to use the televising as a platform to spread their message and radicalize people?	All of these trials need to be televised.  This country needs to see the faces, facts, and what these terrorists were doing and planning on doing.  All these trials need to be the next Tiger King if theres any hope of getting on the same page and unity.  That will only happen after justice is served in the most transparent way possible.	None	It would be a trial.  They only get to speak if they’re testifying, and I’m sure most of them won’t.  If they did, then what they say would be under oath, and they’d be open for cross examination.  I don’t think there’s too much risk of them really spreading their message.  90% of them will just be sniveling cowards when they’re faced with consequences of their actions anyway.	0

gjocjrc	61yo gets bashed for fathering a child on AITA	&gt;and it’s even worse if it’s biological.  Could you elaborate on why the presence of a genetic relationship should make the situation be considered "even worse"?	Theres actually a rule in foster care/adoption in my country (dont know about others tho, but feel free to comment) that the maximum age to take in children is 60. This is to make sure the child can still get properly cared for before becoming an adult. Having a kid at 61 and above is definitely irresponsible, and its even worse if its biological.	None	There’s a higher likelihood for the child to inherit “faulty genes” since DNA mutations accumulate as you age. This is further worsened if the man doesn’t practice a healthy lifestyle as he ages.	0

e727x70	Why Choose Linux....	This is a big point.

With linux, my computer is MY computer, no one can tell me what I can or cannot do, I have absolute control	I choose Linux because I didn't like where Windows was heading with 8 and 10. I also didn't like how aggressive Microsoft was in pushing the Windows 10 "upgrade" to Windows 7 users. Everything I've heard about Windows 10 since has convinced me I made the right decision.  I can choose when to apply updates, and it only takes a few minutes to apply them. Linux doesn't phone home like Windows does. I can reinstall Linux as many times as I want without having to worry about how many activations I have left.  In short, with Linux I feel like I own and control my computer, unlike Windows where it seems like Microsoft controls it.	None	None	0

egt07fg	Crybaby from Hell suddenly stops "wah-ing".	Thanks for the reply. I managed to fix it just now! Turns out there was some slippage with the rack and pinion system in the pot and it wasn't turning right so I corrected it. 	Does it still sweep at all when moving the treadle? Is it possible that the geared piece attached to the pedal came loose and is no longer making contact with the complementary "gear" on the potentiometer?   &#x200B;  Is it otherwise creating an effect, but the sweep is no longer there? If so that really limits what part of the circuit could be at fault. Take off the rubber feet, and/or the associated screws keeping the backplate on and post a picture of the insides if you need more help. 	None	Nice! Keep in mind that you can usually adjust for more range in the "toe" or the "heel" end of the sweep just by where you place the center point of that system. If you find that you're not getting the frequency range you used to, it could need a further adjustment. 	0

This last update issue was bad, but not as bad as the last one. I will say they could have been a bit more generous as far as war credits and gold , but I figure at some point compensation will just end up being a few hundred powercores anyway.

emremqj	San Jose: Traffic fatalities rising	&gt; ...drivers will adjust their driving in time.  I guess we just better hope that all the drivers are local, because this setup is extremely uncommon everywhere, and people just don't know how to safely navigate it.	I had the opportunity to meet with some of the people from SJ-DOT several months ago in a "town hall"-type setting a several months ago after they changed the lanes in my neighborhood, which raised concerns among my neighbors. The SJ-DOT definitely has an attitude that they know best and that drivers will adjust their driving in time.	Everyone gotta get off cell phones on the road. Also the pedestrians--the level of obliviousness I've seen from people walking around with their head craned to their tablet is scary.  &#x200B;  From the story:  \>To try to reach that goal, the report said, the city has narrowed streets to slow down drivers, installed more bike lanes, and upgraded crosswalks.   &#x200B;  I wonder if some of these upgrades inadvertently are causing some of the problems? Some of these changes have come real suddenly, I know I've seen some things that have surprised me recently on the road. I can see some things like that creating problems for inattentive drivers.	They said this regarding an area which the bulk of traffic is not locals (lots of event traffic), so I'm not hopeful.	0

es3dzxo	How append suffix to the end of each line in a list, specified in the text document itself?	I have know idea how to even approach this problem. I can find how to compare lines in lists and how to append things to lines, but not the answer to this question.	What have you tried? Mind sharing a piece of code you tried?	None	You can do list comprehension or a for loop. For loop might be more approachable. Write a for loop and iterate through every item in the list except the first item (which is the state abbrev for all lists, I assume). Before the loop, maybe save the first item of the list into a variable. Within the loop, take the county name, add a comma and space, and add the state abbrev from the variable saved earlier. You can either over write the list's item by saying list\[i\] or you can just print the results to console or you can append it to a new list, whatever fits your needs.	0

They agreed to split Poland down the fucking middle, violating a previous non-aggression pact in the process! There were mass executions of politicians, army officers, academics, priests, and journalists. It wasn't until 2010 that Russia admitted that stalin and other soviet officials had given the orders. There was a big joint parade in Lviv for fucks sake. Just because Germany later fucked them with Barbarossa doesnt change the fact that the Soviets actions in Eastern Europe were pretty fucking dodgy.   And the idea that the USSR gave nothing in negotiations is laughable, German was able to safely consolidate their position in Poland without fear of an imminent Soviet response, not to mention the carving up of eastern europe into two distinct spheres of influence.  Putin uses these same points, namely the idea that the USSR was forced into an immoral, but necessary allegiance due to Western reluctance to help.	A non aggression pact is not an alliance.

I have one video my friend took of me last year, again I consider myself a beginner and don't go that often, so bear that in mind when looking at this... This is me going at a comfortable pace. My friend basically told me to keep doing this motion, and when I feel confident increase the gap between turning left and right.

I don't know if that makes any sense at all, it's been a few months since I've gone.	Do you have any video of you riding? Might help people give pointers.  Typically I keep my weight centered, or even a little bit forward. I'm also very rarely riding flat on my board - always riding the edges. I think it helps with control and makes it easier to slow down if needed.   It took me years to get comfortable enough riding to starting really charging though.

Yup.

fecbdfi	The "it'll never happen to me" happened to me	She could’ve starved to death. How inconsiderate of you.	I was once in the left most lane position with another lane next to me, waiting for a train to cross.  The bars were down and flashing.  I see some woman straddling between my lane and the one next to me, as she gets closer I see she is eating french fries out of a bag.  She somehow managed to roll past me (in my lane) and hit the bar because she was looking for fucking french fries.  Thats the day I realized that you have to keep an eye on everyone at all times, even if you are stopped at at railroad crossing.	Someone said that to me too. It really posed me off. Unfortunately they were right. I went down hard six months later. I was hit by a car who was in the left turn lane and decided to go right. I was wearing shorts and a tee shirt and threw my jacket in the car before my ride because it was too hot and I was only going down the street. I watch out for stupid drivers now and wear my gear all the time.	None	0

fljcp5e	If somebody is rude to you, ask them to repeat themselves. Here's why...	True.   &gt;it's easy to misinterpret things.   Yeah, it for sure is!  Happens in every conversation on some level.  On top of it, sometimes people have a different reaction than we expected but they are understanding perfectly fine.   Another interesting thing, are you like Asian maybe?  In Outliers, it goes over how in like Europe and America, typically the burden is on the speaker to make sure there's understanding. In Asia (in general I guess), it's on the listener. It takes a lot of effort on the listener's part to decode subtle messages.	Also, its easy to misinterpret things. Some peoples sense of humor is different and its hard to get to know someone if you dont ask them to clarify. People always think Im being an asshole, and Im usually complimenting people. I also often think people are being rude, and I just ask do you mean x y and z? More often than not Im wrong, they meant something completely different than what I said. Words are used to describe reality, language is art, no two forms of expression are the exact same.	None	No, I’m not Asian. I just grew up around insecure and uneducated people — poor people who were very aware of real judgement. I had to teach myself how to not be bound by the same basic instincts as they are.  I also learned that if you defend yourself too quickly, you usually get called an asshole, if you can get one other person to notice the thing first — then you can often be a celebrated ass hole. Ask questions, make people clarify, either they aren’t who they seem to be, or they are and now everyone has had the same rewind as you.   That is super interesting though!	0

fmhywff	Pharmacist Jessica Buettner	"drug tested" means absolutely fucking nothing. The tests are incredibly easy to work around. If you were a lifter, to be would know that she is on gear.  There is nothing wrong with it. The issue is that the public believes you can build a physique like her's naturally, with just good training and a good diet. You will not.	she very well be using but your arguments for why are flawed. plenty of high level powerlifters, which she is, and other strength sport athletes have post graduate degrees and challenging careers. i dont know why you would type something like that.  also she competes in ipf and is drug tested. she could be using but its not definitive. shes on the cusp of whats possible naturally, shes not like ifbb pro muscular or anything. i dont get what you and your s/o have to do with anything	Easy to debunk this.   1.

Personaly i love the main story alot and want to see what happens and the sidequests seem in the way.

fr4nxdh	They didn't think the leopards would force them to let their faces be eaten to protect the leopards' rights.	&gt; You can't force someone to accept a gig, no matter the reasoning.  Not quite right here. There are protected classes in the USA. You can't deny a person service simply because they are in a protected class. Eg. you can't deny a person services for being a certain religion, race, gender, disability, veteran status, etc.  Political affiliation is not a protected class. Sexual orientation is in some states.   When religion and sexual orientation protected classes are at conflict, it becomes more complicated because being in a protected class doesn't necessarily mean you have unlimited rights to discriminate against others.  Imagine if it did. You could have all Muslim owned stores refusing to serve Jews or some other horrible outcome.	I feel like the cake story lost all nuance. It isn't that the bakery refused to serve LGBQT, it's that they refused to make a custom (LGBQT themed?) cake. You can't force someone to accept a gig, no matter the reasoning. I don't think anyone reasonable supported the lawsuit. It's the difference between refusing to sell concert tickets to Christians and refusing to play in a church.  Edit: seems a lot of people are trying really hard to not see the difference between selling something to someone, and working for someone. Imagine being an atheist artist and getting sued because you refused a customer who wanted you to paint religious imagery, or vice versa. The morality of the person being hired pales in comparison to the implication of being able to force someone to work for you.	None	This is why I said gig, and not service, and clarified earlier that they wanted a custom made cake, not just buy one. The difference is that for service you are purchasing something, and for commission you are hiring someone.	0

fvvuc9f	Listening to someone talk about making more on unemployment...	No one advocating for an UBI has ever suggested an amount that high. Most common is only $1,000 - $1,500 per month.	Giving $600 a week extra to the involuntarily unemployed for 17 weeks is far, far cheaper than giving it to every adult citizen for 6 months.  The former program will cost less than $337 billion over the four months, versus over $3.774 trillion over six months.  And this is where we transition from "should we have UBI?" to "How do we pay for a UBI?"  And if the answer is MMT, fine - but we should discuss what that means for the economy and for inflation and everything else.	None	There was the proposal by a few senators for $2,000 a month for all adults & children (3 max per household).  It would be temporary (backdated to March and lasting until three months after pandemic was declared no longer an emergency) and means-tested (phases out for incomes over $100K per adult, with no benefit for anyone making over $120K) and available to non-citizens, including undocumented individuals.  With that, you're looking at something around $7.2 trillion a year or $600 billion a month, with an immediate $2.4 trillion cost for the March backdating.	0

fw42hra	So what are we going to do about these radical misogynists false flagging & reporting feminist subs & in some cases even succeeding in getting them banned? The more left-leaning ones get the worst treatment. How do we help them out/retaliate?	Maybe this is controversial, but I think holding men &amp; women to the same androcentric standard is sexist. I also think calling a feminist a TERF or SWERF is the same as calling her a man-hater. It's just a silencing tactic. Feminism isn't a monolith. There can be differences of opinion. No matter how much you disagree with a RadFem's speech, it's just speech in the end. It has yet to insight violence.  Trans people need special rights &amp; protections, all feminists agree on that &amp; that's the only thing that matters. Free speech within feminism is an important quality to defend.

As an adult, the only thing that gets me is visibly broken bones where limbs are facing the wrong way.	I think some of us just don't have mind set that allows us to be scared by something we know is not reality. I wish I could because it sounds so fun. I have played Dead Space and many many other games with surround headphones in the dark at home alone and even though I enjoy the spooky depiction by the creators, nothing actually make some nervous.  I have a VR headset and I have played most of the games considered the scariest. Still fun but doesn't make me scared. Same for horror movies and spook alley's.

I absolutely hated the fact that everything was sold à la carte and was mediocre at best. Found that out when I went to Incirlik and my breakfast was like 15 bucks.   Best galley I’ve been to? Djibouti. I absolutely loved the meals and the food was always great. Even had steak every Friday and crab legs at the end of the month. Would totally deploy there again just to eat at that galley.

g4t7aoe	I genuinely and wholeheartedly believe modern life in general isn't for people like me	Humans have in general been abused for several thousand years in terms of how much work we’re forced to do. However, this doesn’t mean that we’re supposed to be able to cope with it. From a biological standpoint, we’re more equipped to deal with the amount of work per day that was typical of our hunter-gatherer ancestors: 3-5 hours. This would mean anywhere from 27 to 35 hours a week, but split up across all seven days to leave more time for familial, cultural, and personal activities.	Things weren't different in the past tho. People always were worried about necessities and had to work a lot just to get along, some more some less. I would say it was definitely a harder struggle to get basic necessities like food 100 years ago and the majority of the people had to do a lot more often physically hard work to earn their money. Not even starting to speak about agrarian societies and the middle ages were nearly everybody had to do extremely hard field work every day for a little food and lived under incredibly dirty conditions compared to today. Tho material wealth and standard of living doesn't necessarily correlate with happiness, like countries like buthan, nepal are often ranked extremely high on happiness indexes despite the population being dirt poor compared to the western world.

g6l8jgt	I'm ready for the hate comments and Downvotes	 My verdict on the first two games is that they do have some interesting mechanics but are still a bit too easy. If you have some time to kill then there are certainly much worse ways to do it. Though note that eighty percent of the game is fetch-quests.  The battle system is fairly autonomous. You have three mons active at any given time and they will act out their turn independently from you. Either doing a regular attack, Elemental attack or buffing or debuffing another mon (Referred to as “inspiriting”). The player can switch out which mons are active by rotating a wheel on the touchscreen. You also decide when your mons use their special attack.

g719nax	How to Build a Swat Resistant House	For the price to build a fortress, you could pick up and relocate to a more sane part of the world where militarized police aren't as much of a problem.	Building a fortress for a house would probably be about a million dollars for the base model. Buying food, water and a gun is a couple thousand. Its not really reasonable for most people to design and build their own house.   I know you can do both, but realistically Id rather be in a regular, moderately secure house with a weapon than in a purpose built peeper house unarmed.  If someone wants to get in they get in. Fortifications are deterrents for common crooks.	Man, I’m surprised that r/preppers of all communities doesn’t see any potential need for fortifications. Having guns and food is great, but this should really be something that people talk about more.   I don’t own a home yet, but when I do, I plan on fabricating some metal shutters that can be attached to the inside of window wells, and reinforcing my doors. Geez, even just having glass strong enough to take a brick thrown at it without shattering would make a house a lot safer.	None	0

g7j31cq	Why is discussion during vote time so lackluster?	the only reason I can think of is to clear your own name. If someone sees you just walk away from a body like nothing happened that's pretty bad	I dont even seen a point is reporting a body unless you have some evidence. That would prevent all the lackluster conversation.	None	Self reporting is also a known strategy now though. So I’d see it as sus either way.	0

g91l01d	15'4K likes and tons of awards. Lmao these scrubs.	i think the difference with rank play is that you know you're progressing because it tells you what ur rank is. For example, when you're a silver and you start beating golds, you know you're improving and then eventually you get gold, and when you're gold and start beating plats, you know you're improving because you're beating plats. In call of duty public matchmaking, you never know if you're improving or not because the game will put you with people around ur own skill level, except theres no ranks in public matchmaking so you never get a sense that you're improving, hit a plateu, or getting worse. So it just makes the experience shitty.  And the thing is that Public casual matchmaking should not have such aggresive skillbased matchmaking because its a casual gamemode with casual game settings, not ranked. Call of duty pubs have totally different rules then a real ranked competitive game. There are tons of cheap ass guns and perks and loadouts in casual cod pubs that never get fixed while ranked has all the cheap shit banned. So if you're a relatively good player, you will play with people who have near the same stats as you, except they're using super broken loadouts because they're playing in a casual gamemode with no restrictions present.	I find it funny when I was reading about this whole thing, multiple gaming articles were using the phrases "highly debated topic returns with Black Ops Cold War!".  I've dipped my toes in most competitive games and I have never seen any community complain about skill based matchmaking. Quiet the opposite actually, I've witnessed many different games over the years requested rank mode. Even fucking Overwatch had Ranked mode as a highly requested feature.  Its only those Destiny/CoD retards that cry about this.	Most COD players are scrubby ass bitches. Confirmed yet again.  And they mad projecting. Always talking about other “sweats “, when they are the ones in fact sweating all the time worrying about wins/losses and their stats. Just play the game motherfucker, win or lose, if you truly are just playing to “have fun”.  And the term “sweats” or whatever. What a gay ass term. These fucking limp ass scrubs think people who actually try and be good and understand the activity they are participating is something bad or derogatory.  Lmfao.  Always props to those who try to excel in whatever endeavor/hobby they choose to pursue.	League "solves" that in Normal Games by using SBMM to have a relatively balanced amount of skilled players in both teams, averaging the MMR.  The result is utter chaos and a lot of toxicity because there's incredibly fed and incredibly useless people on both teams, but that's the result of a less strict SBMM. I don't see that nearly as often in Ranked.	0

g9kyduc	Crash course on trading VIX options?	How long have you been using this strategy on VIX?	VIX will kill you  The only way to play VIX that I have found to be profitable is at follows  Buy ATM call sell 50%+ OTM calls to create a spread  When VIX surges, roll the ATM call to something above the OTM call you sold and hold the bear call vert  As VIX picks up, VVIX pumps which increases the premium for VIX options  That means that if you buy puts, you will lose value as VIX decreases and VVIX drops also  So the best way to play VIX is to either sell way OTM bear call verticals or how I stated it.  Always do this 2 months out (or the particular month you expect something to happen)  I am only buying Nov VIX spreads now because of the election, or else I would play strictly Dec calls  So for Nov you can do this  Buy $29C Sell $45c  If VIX pops to $32-$35, roll the $29c to $60+c and then just hold the bear call vert to expiration (or take off at 50% profit)	None	I’ve been buying calls and selling bear call verts all year   I used to finance the calls selling atm puts   But I recently started doing it this way in sept and it had been most profitable	0

g9pcd4b	Glick is not best pleased with the latest iteration of De Tomaso	It's not a car enthusiast, it's Consolidated Ideal Team Ventures, a Chinese venture capital group that bought the "De Tomaso" name and IP in 2015, presumably after talking to some random dude who brought a Pantera to a Cars &amp; Coffee.	That's one way to look at things. Another way to look at it is we have another passionate car enthusiast who was lucky to be successful enough in life to start their own car company. I'm sure many of us here would do the same if we were in that fortunate position. And while you may be burnt out on new cars, the market clearly shows that there is plenty of demand for new and exciting cars.   Honestly we should be cheering for more manufacturers to enter the market and build fun and exciting cars. It's better than the same 3 manufacturers building slight evolutions of last generations car over and over.	Fuck Detomaso and every other new "hypercar" brand that think their name means something. These brands rely purely on the exclusivity of their cars and a name that in most cases means nothing to sell cars at an outragious price.	None	0
ga4c23x	(Rant) The cursed "plant based" label on food	It’s ConAgra pulling the strings. They acquired Pinnacle (and Gardein) a couple years ago. They own Marie Callender’s, as well as Bird’s Eye &amp; Healthy Choice, which all have Gardein crossover products on the market	I mean its not really their fault here aside from not stipulating that marie calendar only use their product for vegan stuff. Its on Marie calendar for falsely advertising, as the new trend seems to be with regard to vegan (or vegan) products	Gardein should take the “always vegan” label off their products if they’re gonna do shit like this	That’s fucked then. I mean I’m glad gardien itself is all vegan but I hate that we can’t have anything that doesn’t support animal ag full stop	0

gb5nrps	Some recommendations for niche otomes in English?	Seconding My Vow to My Liege. Phenomenal story, great protagonist, heartwrenching romances.	Hmm... The most niche games Ive played and really enjoyed are probably Changeling, When the Night Comes, and [Were House](https://sad-ghost-studios.itch.io/werehouse), and I wouldnt really call Changeling niche. Were House is super short, super cute, and super recent, so you probably at least havent heard of that. ;)  Games I cant personally vouch for (yet) but are on my wishlist or backlog: Arcade Spirits, Pixel Puzzle Makeout League, My Vow to My Liege, Absolute Alchemical Potion, Animal Lover, The Confines of the Crown, As We Know It, and Sweet Fuse. Sweet Fuse is for PSP/Vita, while everything else is for PC and on Steam and/or itchio. Since I havent played these yet, some might have wishy-washy heroines though hopefully not.

Thanks for the kind comments!  This is my first "nice" car purchase and I've never spent anything close to this much on a car before.  I did it because I really do think the LC is special.  When I test drove it, I was afraid that the hype was just too high and there was no way it could live up to expectations, but IMO it's 100% as good as all the reviewers have said.  Lexus has absolutely knocked it out of the park.	Damn, that's cheap. I've been lusting after the only on sale here, but the price is $117k. 2018 with 15k miles.

A race like that shouldn't have been included in the game in the first place.	None	0
gcwoajo	First time I spotted one of these, I was like..... WHOA	I really wanted Sam to relax and eat a big ol' cheeseburger and french fries like a well deserved American patriot.	The fact that Sam can't eat anything other than cryptobiotes frustrates me to no end.	I wonder if fishing/hunting was considered as a gameplay element. It would make more sense than just seeing Sam live off of Cryptobiotes, Beer and Monster Energy. But then again, having an abundance of wildlife in the world of Death Stranding wouldn’t really add up.	I know, right? Imagine hauling ass on foot across the USA, going through mountains and rivers and deserts, getting electricuted, shot at, dealing with ghosts and not even being allowed to eat like, a hearty  dinner, since you're probably starving and bugs don't yield nearly as much caloric intake as you need? The audacity!	0
gdawjo2	This holiday season, encourage your family members to give you things you already own. Literally wrap up your own stuff to give you under the tree.	if the answer is no, then what are you wrapping them with?	And what if the answer is no?	Do you wrap these items in wrapping paper? Because if so, you're literally just wrapping items you already own in paper, then unwrapping those items and throwing out the paper.. for literally no reason other than lolz. That is wasteful. (for the record, wrapping paper is always frivolous and wasteful)	Who cares? Isn't wrapping things you already own less wasteful than buying things you don't need? That's the point of the post	0
gdfhzvb	The 2021 Kawasaki Ninja ZX-10RR - $29,000 & Only 500 Will Be Made	In fairness, $12k extra for a spring &amp; valve kit and a set of Marchesinis is a bit absurd.	if it doesn't come used from the factory with 50% off, reddit isn't buying it	For $30k I'd rather have a used $20k MX5 RF and a used $10k 899.	It is, but it's also a homologation special.

gdh0hfm	Starting a wheel with a synthetic long?	You're right I just consider any weekly options to be lottery tickets due to how volatile their prices are.   I think the question you need to ask yourself is would you have bought the $115c option if you didn't have the premium to cover it?	Good points and I appreciate your comment. You have captured my short term bullish view accurately; however, I would not describe a long call position with a $115 strike as being a lotto ticket when the underlying is currently at $114 and change. Id reserve that term for the far OTM call matched with low odds of profit.	If you want to get assigned the stock but have a bullish short term view on it I would have sold a deeper ITM put for more premium.  Right now it looks like you're just using your premium to buy a lotto ticket, and are left open to bag holding at a major loss in the event of significant downard movement in the short term.	Good question, especially from my preferred approach of viewing our linked trades as separate.   It’s not my usual strategy, but yes, in these situations (stock 6% down) for this relatively small amount of money, I would be glad to simply buy the call alone.	0

ge48wja	Favorite Character?	I've been calling him reaver Link, and he's my fave for sure	Two handed Link is life. You're surprisingly mobile for using a "heavy" weapon, amplifying your damage at the cost of your health is super fun and adds a bit of a risk to it since getting hit makes that damage permanent. Also ground pounds. Ground pounds make me happy.   Impa is a blast as well, building up your clones with combos rather than C0 is neat and makes her really fluid. Once your at full clones you absolutely melt bosses, and anything else for that matter. Her teleports add an inherent safety to her as well that not a lot of other characters get, so you can time your attacks right and just plow through enemy hits.  We'll see who takes the cake after I unlock everything though, this game is mad fun.	None	None	0

gepgy8h	100-Hour Lasagna	Do you think the end result wasn't good, or are you only focusing on his methods? Blind adherence to culinary rules will make you a worse cook.	I agree. This guy doesn't know what he's doing but he fools culinary retards into thinking it's special.	Pasta grannies channel will make a lasagna in 5 minutes - I’ve never seen anyone use 11 yokes to make such a small amount of sfoglia, was it just for colour or did you leave out a huge amount? Typically it’s 1 egg to 100g 00 flour.   We don’t need to see you pour wine into a glass- this is annoyingly self indulgent.   100 hours for lasagna, such a needless amount of time for a dish that will taste just as good and take a single afternoon.   Also this is far from artisanal. None of the tools are specialized except for the pasta roller which isn’t particularly special because a way more artisanal way would be to use a mattarella. It’s also just a normal pasta recipe with too many yokes and there is no reason to use as many, or ONLY yokes. I’ve literally never seen anyone use only yokes unless is was one extra.	Well said	0

gfuyryq	Hades is Polygon's Game of the Year	I’ll give you my opinion even though it’s against the grain. To me it was overhyped to shit. Like seriously. My first thing I wanted when I got my switch was BOTW after the immense hype over it. It’s an open world game with link as the main character. There are some cool details but my god is that game criminally overrated. The dungeons are awful, I won’t spoil them, but too few and not clever puzzle wise. The bosses are an absolute joke (minus one who gave me a bit of stick you’ll know when you get to them). The open world is nothing special. The weapon breaking mechanic is nothing new and the inventory space is a pain. The shrines with all 120 felt like lacklustre puzzles and I would rather that effort got poured into more and better dungeons. Don’t even get me started on the motion control shrines. The combat is really nothing special, dodge and flurry rush becomes your absolute staple, killed a Lionel with three hearts as an absolute new player with that, and it’s basically all I did the entire game because tbh the game doesn’t promote any other ‘better’ play style well enough that is just as simple to pull off with similar damage. The story is close to non existent. Play it, and see for yourself you might honestly love it like everyone else, but at best this was a 6/10 experience for me. I just think the hype and the groupthink made the issues so glaringly looked over. Windwaker is a better Zelda if you’re looking to scratch that itch.	How good is BotW? (without spoilers)	I have to fully agree. Best game I've played since BotW.  I laughed out loud when I saw the credits, amazing how such a small team can make something this amazing.	You nailed it with this BOTW review.  Every point I am in total agreement.	0

I cant learn to fix a car from taking apart watches and how to build stairs by taking apart boxes in real life, but I can in the game	None	yes they try to go for realism the majority of time so its just dumb to make stove explose like that if in real life its rarely appen unless there is a default in the stove	0
gglzwws	“I’d rather be hated for who I am, than be loved for who I am not.”	I feel like you're missing something important here:  The title statement is *comparative.* It says that being hated on is preferable to having to pretend to be someone you're not, just to avoid being  hated on.  I agree with you that nobody is immune to hate and in the end we all care, including OP. But sometimes, there are worse things, and getting hate is the least bad option.	No, youre not. Youre pretending you are, or your ignoring it. People cant even be cool with the hatred of people *they* hate. Whatever army of haters you imagine yourself interesting enough to collect, you care deeply about their opinions. Why, you came here *just to post about how you dont care*. Definitely sounds like someone who doesnt give a shit. Be honest, or dont talk.

I'm surprised with 'woke politically correct' culture they even gave the option for white people to say yes.	And what was the white response rate? Probably pretty low.

ggpb7nl	What banner is better?	Someone was probably triggered because how *dare* you suggest Sucrose could be better than Venti depending on comp /s  I agree with you. I have both and find with my play style, I enjoy using Sucrose more than Venti, especially since Venti makes mobs unreachable for my Zhongli usually lol	I'd go for the next one.  Fischl is a crazy good support due to her long lasting, reliable pet and ease in which she can deploy it (both skill and burst deploy Oz).  Sucrose is arguably better than Venti depending on team. More energy generation than Venti and better at keeping targets in attacking range, but less raw CC and ult spam. Also Venti isn't even available right now meaning Sucrose utility is exclusive to her for you.  Bennett is insanity.  Edit: Why on earth is this being downvoted.

gh41tn5	And we have to stop doing this if we want to do anything but continue enabling Republicans.	This is a great point! A somewhat related thing Dems have to deal with is the fact that our weird system means the median nationally elected offices tend to tilt republican. Between gerrymandering and the democrats tending to concentrate in and around cities the median U.S. House district tends to lean a few points to the right. In the Senate the median State is more like 6 or 7 points Republican. The result is Democrats have to win a bunch of purple and red districts to gain power. This maddening outcome of this is that Democrats have to be perceived as very moderate to win and Republicans have a lot of room to do shitty unpopular things.	In the [exit polls](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/exit-polls-president.html), 38% of Americans identified as "conservative" while only 24% identified as "liberal". Appealing to the base isn't going to work the same way for each party - particularly since the GOP is a white Christian identity party (and white Christians are a majority of the electorate), while the Democratic party is a coalition of diverse groups.   Nobody should be stuck in the basement, but Democrats have to be really careful about finding issues and messages that appeal to swing voters and loyal partisans alike. All that "twitters" is not gold.	None	None	0
gh43ver	And we have to stop doing this if we want to do anything but continue enabling Republicans.	Definitely, there was some cool polling on this [recently](https://twitter.com/patrickruffini/status/1196495706531471364). Sorry it's a twitter thread.	If we had ranked choice voting I think her and Bernie would be in an entirely separate party. The New Democrats and Progressives would be their own separate things.	AOC is becoming weird in her takes. She is separating herself from Democrats and splitting up the party. This is a terrible strategy. This take is a legitimate issue, but there are currently other issues to be more vocal about. Solutions to real problems aren’t always that simple. Look at how far we’ve gone since Republicans had every branch and both houses. Keep your eyes on the prize, but you have to have a realistic strategy to win it. Politics is about winning and losing.

gh5f0md	How much milk, cream, evaporated milk do I put in for the Flanders Hot chocolate?	Thanks!	I can't say for sure, because I'm not Babish, but I used another recipe as a reference for their ratios of sugar/cocoa powder to liquid.      [https://celebratingsweets.com/homemade-hot-chocolate/](https://celebratingsweets.com/homemade-hot-chocolate/)     In this one, it seems to be 4 cups liquid per quarter cup sugar/cocoa powder. This recipe uses more chocolate (specifically, chocolate chips) than Babish, but Babish makes up for it more cocoa powder and sugar.      Adjusting to his other measurements, I'd say he intended for 8 cups of liquid - 4 cups whole milk, 2 cups heavy cream, 2 cups evaporated milk.       If making this for the first time, it might not be a bad idea to have a little extra whole  milk lying around if it gets too thick and rich for you.      You can adjust with a little more or less by tasting as you go, but I think that 8 cup amount is plausible based on the ease of 8 divided by four parts and the reference recipe.	None	None	0

gh7hnoe	Seasonal char on non season server	You don't even need to be on the season server to accept those ones, or any season quest.  But I would recommend looking for or trying to form a platoon to get those done.  Those 5000 kills go pretty quick with a large group. Most of those are formed on a season server.	So like I can accept the weekly quests for Fogan, Bashin, Naga etc. on seaon and grind them on non-season? That would really work for me.	The downside is no season specific enchanting drops.

gic1cm1	Weekly /r/Breadit Questions thread December 30, 2020	Thanks!	This might sound more complicated than it is:  Get 2 cups / jugs. Pour cold water into one of them, hot water into the other one. Put your thermometer in the jug with cold water. Transfer a little of the hot water into the jug, stir and repeat until you get the temp you want. (or go the other way round)  Anyway, you probably don't need to worry too much about water temperature. +/- a few degrees will be alright.  If the water is for dough, the temp of your other ingredients, hands, bowl,  air, hook, will play a part in the final temp.	It seems like a lot of bread recipes call for a very specific water temperature. Is there some trick to easily finding the temperature you want? Kitchen sink taps aren't designed for temperature precision, so I find that I end up holding my thermometer under the water as I kind of tap the handle and hope that I get it right. And it seems like even small changes in the handle position can cause a large swing in the temperature, so I have to keep going back and forth.	None	0

gil6uon	I hope they don't hold back on the references	Well yes, but say things like the star wars productions of recent times, they all, imo, do too much fan service where it feels like all they want it nostalgia to do the job.   If it makes sense for the story to talk about certain things in the lore, ofc one should do it, it adds to the atmosphere, understanding, while also making fans happy, but if you simply drop it for its own sake, then no i think it's a bad idea.	Yeah, I don't want them to turn to the camera and name drop lol	Only if it is organic, references and easter eggs for the sake of fan service destroy meaningful storytelling	Speaking of Star Wars, one thing I don’t want to see much of in a prequel is obvious references to the future, such as Obi-Wan saying to Anakin, “Why do I think you’ll be the death of me?”. They can show the Lords of Andunië, for example, without trying to make it obvious to the casual viewer that Aragorn is descended from them, such as by having one of them say “If by my life or death I can protect you, I will,” or something else that Aragorn later says in the book or the movies.  Also, I hope they don’t feel like they have to show the origin of everything, like Han Solo’s last name in *Solo*. Of course some things are probably inevitable simply because they’re part of the Tolkien’s backstory of the stories of Bilbo and Frodo: the forging of the Ring, the construction of Barad-dûr, or the founding of Rivendell, for example. But they don’t necessarily have to show how the first Butterbur of Bree got his name, or the first Ferny. In fact, I would think inherited surnames would be largely out of place in the Second Age.	0
giltrlq	Why do people say that Tolkien places too much emphasis on descriptions?	I mean, that's a little too easy of a statement. "Great literature" isn't defined by using a specific style of prose. There are many different, varied styles out there which all produced 'great literature'. What people oftentimes overvalue in fact is the stylistic approach (still important ofc), where great art truly becomes great is with the insight it gives, that there is a vision worth telling.	They are unaccustomed to great literature.	None	That was just my first thought off the top of my head.  Another thought has occurred to me; I don't know if there's much value in it.  Read some older stories, say, from before World War I. The prose tends to be highly descriptive. For instance, a person's appearance, face, hair, stature, form, gait, and apparel will often be described in exacting detail. (And, fairly often, as revelatory of the person's character.) Why? Before the advent of widespread photography and cinematography, that's how an author conveyed to the reader the look of a character. And, more importantly, that's what people were used to and what they expected. Nowadays, we are much more influenced by photography and cinematography: especially by way of TV and movies, we are used to *seeing* how a character looks, and are unaccustomed to being told about a person's look in such detail.

gin18qi	Triumph of the Vulgar	One of the reason all of this shit happened is because of an absence of nuance. Yes, the US is one party away from a one party state. That does not mean that every politician in office is in cahoots. Do not fall for the same trap they did.	Politics is a bread and circus meant to make you think you have power or a voice. The same billionaires are never going to give you a chance. There is no such thing as victory. Victory is when the media owned by said billionaires tells you to be happy, that the "right" billionaires are now in office.  It is hilarious that anyone thinks anyone capable of running for president gives a single fuck about them or the United States as a whole. There are no good guys. Their only purpose is to divide us with the illusion of choice.   Republicans saying its now a 'one party state', it already was. They're all in cahoots. They always were. Trump vs Biden is less real than a WWE match. I guarantee those two clinked champagnes once and will do so again.	None	None	0

I cannot understand bringing such pathetic bullshit into a game like this	Yeah Border Prince has been on my don't watch list for a while now. When 9th edition got annonced he was livestreaming it with Arch and made some shitty comments about black space marines.	If only it meant they at least had a warped understanding of representation. The black space marine doesn’t invalidate the legions (heh) of white-looking warrior monks that are canon. Some people that think space marines should look multi-ethnic because that’s a more reasonable assumption for the far future and only prefer variation, these crybabies are the only ones insisting on weird homogenizing and somehow can’t stand if their 100000 totally-not-self-inserts have one black equal.

giuhuq6	Saying hello to neighbors who give a dirty look and don’t say anything back?	This is exactly what I was thinking.

In many parts of the NE it is considered off-putting to force interaction with strangers.  They're probably sitting there going, "oh God, oh God she's going to talk to me again. Oh God, please no"	Politeness isn't universal, it's culturally and subculturally dependent. You're bringing in an outside expectation of etiquette. You can continue doing so, but know that the people think *you're* the rude one for being disruptive.

giv7l4d	Everytime I read about it I can't stop thinking how great of an OOF that is (Learning skill)	Still better than Eagle Eye, which costs 3 levels, a secondary slot and gives you nothing in return.	So you're basically down with your skills for 3 levels (spending 3 points to become an expert in Learning - that's one of the most rarest cases - if not the only one - where learning makes you actually retarded) and yet you aren't even guaranteed to get that extra level when you're level 10.  Wiki page: https://heroes.thelazy.net/index.php/Learning	None	Well, both are shitty, but I guess if I had to choose I'd go for  * Eagle Eye on Medium (or smaller) maps - there are less towns, thus less Magic Guilds, thus (again) there is a smaller chance you learn all the spells, but you can learn something from a fight. Still you won't be getting too many levels in most cases, so Learning wouldn't do shit  * Learning on L (and bigger) maps - you are able to reach levels 20 or higher, so I guess there is a slight chance it might come in handy. There are lots of towns and you won't really encounter enemy for a long time, so there won't by any use for Eagle Eye	0

gixez4m	So, I can’t help but notice that “god” isn’t a common word here..	I am plenty happy and not at all being negative. It's the notion of the burden of proof. That is why you don't see many people throwing the God term around here. Everyone will have their own perception of God and only whenever they've deliberately taken hallucinogenic drugs. Its not surprising to see something God like on one of the worlds strongest psychedelic/hallucinogenic drugs. But its no more credible than me saying God is a giant ham and cheese sandwich and heaven is actually made out of spaghetti. Unless I can prove even some of it.. the idea is to be dismissed. That's not to say our experiences don't actually happen to us. But the question is: is it the drug overloading your sensory systems, or is God only visible to some of us and only under the influence of extremely strong drugs? The latter is... much less believable.	Oh, and I mean... being shown gods feelings and shit.. its whatever man. I dont claim to know whats going on, I only tried to express what I feel. I can tell that society has some of you dismissing anything other than what you personally think. Its all good, just be happy.	Well everybody who makes a claim like "I encounter God. Period." Should be dismissed immediately. That is a claim which requires a burden of proof that NOBODY in history has managed to meet. It is completely unreasonable to expect people to believe someone who makes that claim. But if you claimed that you took hallucinogenic drugs that made you have an experience that feels like you met entities outside of our realm of understanding, that isn't really unreasonable at all. Claiming to have encountered the Supreme being of the universe that is the one and only source of everything is a claim that most people absolutely would never entertain listening to unless they were already indoctrinated in a system of faith that correlates to the being you claimed to see.

Plus those ones are cheap on the used market, looks beautiful and high value.  Was curious about how owners actually felt about it	I do, Ive only had it a few weeks but from all the research Ive done maintenance costs are Hyundai prices. So depending on what it is it shouldnt be too expensive. I know the one thing that can get expensive on these though is the air suspension, but they do make a strut master conversion kit. So if mine ever fails that will probably be the route I go.	Do you still have the equus? How's the maintenance cost on those?	Anytime! I went from a base model 2017 Kia Optima to this, so definitely an upgrade. But you’re right it’s a great value. It has 90k miles and I got it for $12k which for a $65k price tag new I think is a pretty great deal.	0

gj1ho6s	Don’t want 60 seconds of adjustment? Ok, enjoy waiting 6 weeks.	I had to have root canals on two teeth next to each other (they had broken when I was very young, and about twenty years later the temporary cap was no longer protecting the teeth and they became infected, one year apart). After the second one, the dentist told me I would need crowns on those teeth, because temporaries would just keep drying out and falling off.  After the second root canal, a year apart from the first, I noticed I still had some occasional phantom sensitivity in that tooth. I never had that problem in the one next to it, so I thought maybe some nerve tissue had been left behind or something. It isn't painful.  I told the dentist about it, but he didn't really say anything.  Then they prepped the teeth for crowns, put the crowns on, and now months later I still have some sensitivity in that tooth. But I'm afraid to say anything, because I don't want them to have to fuck around with my tiny nub of a tooth with a metal post in it just to remove some sensitivity. Especially if it means buying a new crown.	How long did you wait?  I just had a back crown put in 3 weeks ago and its still a little sensitive if I bite down on anything hard.  And afterwards I get a dull throb for a couple of hours before it goes away.  I have another appointment to go back tomorrow, but it's already been adjusted once and I'm terrified about them pulling it and having to redo it all over.	I had this happen. Cap felt high every time. The dentist suggested that it was just that I wasn't used to having anything there because the temp has fallen out three weeks ago and suggested we just wait and see. I said "okay." It's fine now. Not much of a story but I'm better off than that lady.	None	0

gj3mkq2	can you trade through chat?	His damage is good but as it's just raw damage so falls off due to armour unless you subsume a stripping ability which then makes your energy eco suffer... Don't expect to be doing much in later content like the steel path without a serious commitment.  Building him for crits is the way to go but it's clunky and unreliable without arcane avenger.  Pretty much anything regarding his wall/ball/stone golems is bad to the point of it being a meme. The 4 augment does less than not help.  Extra loot augment for his petrify is ok but he doesn't really have too many slots to run it comfortably as you need to build eff, str and range without completely killing duration to use it...  You also might run in to energy issues without either really high eff or a mix of arcane energize and the passive augment.  So yeah... he's alright, but not fantastic.

gjc5hoe	Is it worth continuing our existence for the sake of understanding our universe?	Not the person you asked, but many ANs are not in it for personal reasons or gains, many are _altruistic antinatalists,_ meaning that they consider the suffering of others and would like to minimize or eliminate it if possible, _that's why AN is a form of negative utilitarianism in philosophy,_ so they consider the global suffering of both the human and nonhuman animals, and it is obvious that the rate of suffering is just higher, and when you compare suffering versus pleasure, suffering is more intense since most people won't choose to suffer the worst form of torture in order to experience the best pleasure.  It's good that your daughters make you happy, and I hope it stays that way, but many people are dealing with difficult situations where their children have chronic health conditions, and no one can predict the future to guarantee a continuous happy life, no one could be certain that all challenges will be overcome, so ANs refrain from starting a potentially problematic existence since no one misses out on anything prior to procreation.	Im curious, as a follow up, when you say life brings more suffering and needs than joy, how do we consolidate that with the joys of overcoming challenge? Like... some challenges are more insurmountable than others, but I think I *DO* believe that a world of constant and consistent joy, in fact would have no joy again because we would have no understanding of the concept of the challenge to earn the joy afterwards. A classic argument, but I have two daughters and although Im still agnostic and non religious, I still find incredible joy in the pride of seeing my little ones discover the wonders of the world, and the excitement of overcoming obstacles that, at times, have caused them to cry in despair. Thoughts?	No, antinatalism is about consenting, life brings more suffering and needs than joy so why put others through it if no one asked for it. So what if we are an anomaly, or we can somehow someday manage to tell what came before this or what will came after, it’s nobody’s duty. Those answers only hold importance to some of us, and then again if we discover it, this knowledge is meant to be lost and forgotten once our species goes instinct, and if other “intelligent” species find it, it will inevitably be lost and forgotten too	No I agree, it’s a very logical argument. It’s funny, I mentioned in another post that back on my birthday last year, I died for a short while. I’ll spare the details but the most ironic thing was happening, just before I was dragged under into complete unawareness I was *explaining* to someone else how I would never do something that carries with it a risk of death by said event. I used the example of skydiving and nitro circus. I don’t want to die by falling from a plane or crashing my motorcycle so I choose not to partake in those activities, in the off chance that things go wrong and that’s it for me.   I still feel that way, but your argument feels similar in that, you don’t want to risk an unwilling unborn life to live a life of misery, and wish other people would stop as well, because the benefits only have a *chance* to outweigh the negatives. Not worth the dice throw.   Sounds very logically sound, I don’t disagree. I have some contentions but it would be me only posing anecdotal based arguments, which doesn’t satisfy the overarching argument that you guys make. Very interesting to ponder and try to reconcile with my other beliefs.  Whoever downvoted me, your moms a ho.	0

gje3buz	Are clear marbles rare at all? I read some can be handmade but idk how to tell	They're asking about handmade clearies, not machine made. Handmade ones have pontils.	Here is a quote from the Marble Collector's Society of America:      As with many of the other manufacturers of the time, Akro Agate produced a staggering number of single-color marbles. They produced both clearies, which are transparent clear or transparent colored glass marbles, and opaques, which are opaque colored glass marbles. These marbles have little value to todays collectors for several reasons. First, they were produced in such mass quantity that they are abundantly available. Second, since they were the easiest marble to produce, every marble company produced them. It is virtually impossible to distinguish between each company s marbles of this type. Finally, because the marbles are only one color, they do not have much eye appeal.      Source: https://www.marblecollecting.com/marble-reference/online-marble-id-guide/akro-agate-co/	None	And amateurs often mistake machine made seams for pontils. The marble in the picture is machine-made, not handmade. I have never seen an old handmade clearie, but I have seen dozens of people convinced that their obviously machine made marbles are antique and handmade.	0

gjez3t4	Even if the LDS church is “true”, it’s upper leadership is responsible for many people leaving due to the deliberate measures taken to hide the true history and current behind-the-scenes working of the church.	It’s the same crisis. “How come there is hard evidence out there that contradicts official Church publications?” It’s a crisis of faith in the Church itself and in what you’ve been taught by the Church.   Once you doubt what the Church tells you about one thing, you start doubting what they’re telling you about other things. Perhaps the good feelings I’m feeling while praying are internal? Can I even tell the Holy Ghost feeling apart from dopamine/seratonin/adrenaline? Am I actually getting answers from God? Is God real?   It all starts to fall apart. It takes a couple of years for the process to work itself out, with many ups and downs here and there, but it happens.	I definitely agree with this. But I also think that, to some extent, Church history issues become placeholders for more deep-seated faith issues. The Church's wrongful obfuscation of, for example, the BoM translation process doesn't have any bearing on the merits of the Book of Mormon as God's word. If the Church really wants to do a better job retaining members, it needs to realize that its issues with Church history are often the impetus for faith crises, but often the there are deeper issues as well.	None	>It’s a crisis of faith in the Church itself  I like this. Viewing "faith in the Church" as trust instead of belief. It's fitting for this topic.	0

gjfpubp	C++ Performance Trap #1: Constant-size std::vector	Finally a fellow person coding on 1960's hardware.	> and not c-style arrays  Unfortunately, if you care about compile times <array> header is too heavy on all current stdlib implementations.	As mentioned in the article, `std::vector` is widely promoted as a great “default” container, but it's pretty obvious that that doesn't extend to “constant size” vectors. That's what `std::array` is for (and *not* c-style arrays).	Slower compile times mean slower iterations then you're trying to figure most efficient way to solve a problem. Which leads to less approaches tried.  But it's not only about coding on not so fast computers. It's additional waits for CI before branch merges.  IMO it's worth it if simple replacement of std::array with raw array in key spots leads to 5% faster builds.	0

The only difference is that it's not their personal agenda to promote body positivity for intact men.  They only enforce their rules to keep away opinions or posts they don't like, but then suddenly disappear and are nowhere to be seen when opinions that do support their agenda break the rules.

gjhfizh	In Avengers: Endgame (2019), Scarlet Johansson throws herself off a cliff so she doesn’t have to be part of the girl power scene	Personally, regardless of the fact that I am a woman (inb4 /r/AsABlackMan), as an audience member, I did feel it was shoehorned in. It wasn't as smoothly done as (for example) what the Mandalorian recently did in assembling an all female scene. However, now that I know it references an actual comic team, the scene is a lot more reasonable in that context.	https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-Force   The A force was a marvel all female team. That's what this scene is referencing.   The MCU and the Infinity movies were filled with nods to comics and fan service. Nobody complained when we got a million comic references and team ups, but the moment they reference a real all female comic team, all the fragile male Redditors lose their mind and complain for years about the scene	Now that I think about it it’s kinda funny that they didn’t include the most badass character played by the most talented actress in the MCU in that scene. She was even there for a longer period of time.	This guy is just doing weird retconning, I can't find anything from directors saying this was the intent and the characters involved doesn't make sense with his version of events. Hell, the A-force comics lasted for a tiny run and were shut down because of no sales, why would they even do an homage to that?	0

gjk1gcr	I am the corpsehand from the Antinatalist band cosmic slam. I will be answering your questions.	 Great, partial anonymity could go a long way. About letting parents know, I think it's best to not let them know, I see little reason for that, unless it came up in a conversation.  &gt;All my friends are sentient focused antinatalists. My activism is something my friends support and we can discuss every aspect about activism.  You're lucky to have such friends, but since you're a _sentient focused antinatalists? How do you view the consumption of humanely (stunned) slaughtered livestock?	I try to hide it from my family since I think it is a very slim chance i'll convince them, + it would make me and my family very uncomfortable. I did tell one of my uncles tough for some reason.  By not showing it to my family there won't be any negative incentives to make videos, wich is an advantage. I don't have any natalist friends. All my friends are sentient focused antinatalists. My activism is something my friends support and we can discuss every aspect about activism.  I show my face, but I won't reveal my name to the audience due to the corpsehand persona being better. I am willing to use my facebook account to share the content, but I won't tell everyone my full name on the channel. One reason I don't tell people my real name is that i see no advantage for doing so. The corpsehand just sounds cooler and I am not accomplished in my life to make natalist think antinatalists are a succesfull bunch of people.	Great to have you here, it's courageous to take antinatalism out to the public, but if you won't mind, I'm curious to know whether you are still anonymous, if not, how does your activism affect your relationship with friends and family? Thanks.	I am a negative utilitarian so i judge actions to be unethical wether it causes suffering or not. Eating animals itself doesn't always seem to cause suffering, but buying the product does. For example if one sees a roadkill then one could hypotethically still eat it if the damage is already done. Problem is if you are living with somoene they might have eaten it themself, so eating a product can cause more suffering. One doesn't know what future holds for ones cognitive function. The cognitive function might decline due to brain damage, aging, cancer, so anything that interferes with a strong plant based habit is potentially damaging in the future. So i might not always be a vegan in the future if I hit my head really hard one day.  Even if animals are slaughtered painlessly wich is a ridiculous thing to believe, they still suffered trough their life. First of all there is the animals that died quickly after or during birth. The living conditions, the pulling of teeth, the clippings of tail. That they are even born at all is enough reason for me to deem it unethical. Also if you think about how long the chain of progeny a factory farm animal can create then it is potentially huge. Birth rarely stops with just one offspring. The reason we are alive right now is due to countless progeny that suffered and that same thing can happen in the future if factory farm animals reproduce. The number of suffering offsprings sentient beings can create is huge. When i go to the mall and i look around i see people unknowingly creating massgraves.  Also there is this thing called the near death experience. Since stopping the animals heart doesn't kill brain activity at first then who knows what terror a dying animals brain can give itself. Also mishaps can occur during stunning, people do mistakes. Also animals can experience before the slaugher and they are not blind to what happens to the other animals. There are going to be experience lot of fear.  I have not read up on stunning and what really happens, I can read about it and give a better response. I know about carbon dioxide gassing, it hurts a lot.	0

gjowq4o	One easy way to improve Voyager: massively reduce the size of the crew	I didn't know that; I thought Voyager was the first one to go CGI from the outset.	> Voyager's a CGI model  Not until the latter seasons.  At the start, it was a traditional physical model without many shots actually being filmed and so the ship would often be shown limping along at impulse for no good narrative reason.	I don't think you have to cut down to 25. Even 75 or 80 would be enough. The trick is *obsessive* bookkeeping. You can't have the premise without keeping track of this stuff. You don't need full serialization, but if every crewman was named, and you knew the face (if not the name) of the redshirt in the shuttlecraft who died... and now the mentions of the crew is 76 instead of 77... Voyager's a CGI model, so tweaks can be permanent and cumulative much easier...  You could do this with small bookkeeping and consistency in the writers room and sfx departments. It makes me sad that they didn't.	I think the start sequence might all be CGI, but the in-episode shots were all definitely models.  They made a big thing about the Voyager model having lots of little slide photos of the sets in its windows.	0
gjoxewx	One easy way to improve Voyager: massively reduce the size of the crew	Given that he came from DS9, which had amazing continuity, and was only on Voyager for a few weeks... that wouldn't surprise me in the slightest.  But this stuff isn't even that hard. It's just updating the series bible as you go with the revised crew numbers and supply amounts. You could change nothing about any of the episodes except the offhand 'I'm not going to abandon the [number] officers under my command' and 'we only have ~~a few~~ [X number] of weeks of supplies left' comments, add some throwaway lines when the torpedos and shuttles get low about 'having stocked up' or 'having traded for supplies' and you're 70% of the way there.   You want most of the other 30% without any serious work, take episodes like Drive and Alice, use those as storytelling engines to replenish those numbers. You've built the sets and commissioned the models (digital or otherwise) for that episode. It'll SAVE YOU MONEY to keep using them. Slap a 'USS VOYAGER' on the nose in big white after the episode, and you'll rapidly develop a knowledge that 'this ship uses mismatched stuff' from casual viewers, so in syndication they won't be thrown off. No one except pedants like us (who *would* catch all the episodes) give a damn about prop continuity anyway, but it adds verisimilitude.   Bam, continuity established and syndication preserved.	Gosh now Im kind of wondering if President Roslins white board with the count of every person left alive in the fleet was partially inspired by Ron Moores frustration from working on Voyager.

That was something I always wanted to see on Voyager.  I was disappointed that after Scorpion, they removed all the Borg stuff from the hull for example, and it would have been interesting to see the isokinetic cannon from ~~Relativity~~ Retrospect (which they actually did trade for and have in their possession, right?) installed on the ship (or at least used once!).  It would have added much realism to the show had the ship evolved in appearance as new tech gets added, or damaged components get swapped out with non-Starfleet ones that are roughly equivalent.	0

gjp7gr7	Why does "h" become "г"?	&gt;бог  I understand that the г in бог is the Russian adaptation of Kievan Church Slavonic pronunciation that was in vogue at that time.	It's a tradition which has continued from the time when the standard pronunciation of *--* was something like a voiced /h/ (or unvoiced, if it appeared word-finally or before another unvoiced consonant). We still pronounce it that way in some words, e. g. [**](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/Ru-.ogg), [**](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Ru-.ogg), [**](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/Ru-.ogg).

gjpdt2e	The Nomads from Cyberpunk 2020/Red/2077 should be a clan of riggers	The GM can do whatever they want with the world. Saying that they can't exist just means that they're not trying hard enough to make them exist in the world. It's your game, do what you like.  Maybe they are secretly backed by corps, or they have connections with the natives, or any number of other things. It just takes a little thought to work it out.  Or just do it on a smaller scale. All kinds of ways it can work.	Aren't there places where corporate or state control is pretty weak? Like the eastern parts of CalFree, the australian Outback or the SOX.	The main reason why Nomads exist in Cyberpunk is that corporations and countries are much weaker in the setting than they are in Shadowrun. There are way more zones of no-man's-land and by the time of Cyberpunk RED, Nomad clans have control of shipping in most of the world. They exist not only as pseudo-nations but also have a near monopoly in one particular section of economy.   Meanwhile, bringing in Nomads to Shadowrun would make them much weaker. There are Go-Gangs that have spread far and wide but the type of legitimate position that Nomads have achieved simply by being so powerful would not exist in Shadowrun. Megacorps and countries would not let Nomads be so independend nor would corps let them control shipping when there's good money to be made there. So basically, Nomads in Shadowrun would be major gangs and smugglers. Still useful to know by Shadowrunners, still able to make things happen, but Nomad nations would not be on the map.	When I thought about it I first imagined them as a sort of mix between different nomadic cultures from the american midwest/prairie. Maybe they have conflicts with the CAS or even Native American states like the PCC or the Sioux Nation.   Or maybe they are descendants of Sinti & Roma people but I think I should make research before I try to write Nomads as descendants of certain cultures (I don't want to appropriate stuff or offend someone).	0

gjpj0pm	How to properly sort trash?	yes, so I've heard. That's why I'm contemplating throwing small plastic items (especially smelly plastic items) in the general garbage, as my assumption is that it will be incinerated, without going through arduous manual processing first.  But the guidelines haven't changed to reflect this fact. Maybe Germany does something different? Maybe it's storing plastic to figure out what to do with it later?	In the end, it doesn't really matter anymore what you do with your plastic. Since China stopped importing plastic waste, it's not profitable to recycle low value plastic waste (which is most of the plastic produced). Only for big, heavy pieces of plastic it's still worth it. In the end, most of it will end up in a landfill or incinerator, so I don't feel that guilty if some plastic ends up in my normal trash.	None	While it's sadly true that actual recycling rates are still low, the secondary reason for separation guidelines is an economical. All packaged consumer goods have to be registered by their producers and a corresponding disposal fee be pre paid. Ergo the cost of garbage disposal is already factored into your purchases. In return, the provisioning and emptying of garbage bins for recyclables is free, tenants or homeowners only get charged for residual waste bins.	0
gjppiey	My face when i'm off drugs 3 months and i open the deep web to get some lsd and i got to learn cryptography to order a fucking tab	Hello there. Thanks for advertising the sub!

If /r/darknet doesn't ban these kinds of posts and the users who make them, the whole subreddit can get banned by the admins. So the posts will have to be removed anyways - please don't make the mods' jobs harder by submitting or encouraging these posts. All posts about the darknet technology are very much welcome though.	It's actually pretty easy and LSD is dirt cheap. We're talking 1.50 for 200ug tabs, and that's not even in bulk orders. All you need is:  A Tails usb boot drive (watch a yt video), A link to a reputable market (I can't name one here but you can use dread or something to source), An account on a crypto exchange like binance (and Cakewallet if you're using monero), A basic understanding of PGP encryption if you're using a secure site (Tails has a PGP system integrated into it so this shouldn't be hard at all).  All told, this process will cost you the price of a USB stick and a spare few hours. It will save you ridiculous amounts of money as you can literally buy shit for the same price as many of your plugs. I'd reccomend visiting r/darknet for more info.

gjq357o	Kill the dog, then While everyone celebrates... 🤣	Technically they can. I train service dogs. There are two questions you’re allowed to ask as per the ADA. The first one is useless: “Is the dog a service animal?” They can easily say yes even if that’s a lie.   The second question is also easily lied in response to but requires them to be a bit more knowledgeable: “What task is the animal trained to perform/what does it do to help you?” You can’t require the animal to actually demonstrate it’s task, but you can ask what it’s trained to do, and if they’re not prepared for that question it actually can catch them out. The ADA defines a service dog as one trained to perform a specific task that assists with or mitigates a disability. An emotional support animal wouldn’t qualify as a service dog since that’s not a specific task.   In a case like the one in this episode, I dare say he’d have a hard time identifying a specific task the dog performs to help him with foot pain. This part of the episode actually irritated me, fake service dogs are a real problem for the service dog community. I shared Amy’s enthusiasm for exposing this guy. XD	I mean hes not wrong technically establishments arent allowed to question the disability or the animal as long as its a service animal. Not sure about support animals though (and yes there a difference)	None	It feels weird to me that there aren't obligatory documents or certificates for this. You wouldn't need to explain how the dog helps you, just something to ensure that it's a service dog.	0
gjq8id9	Can you ECU tune a non sports car? I own a 2015 Subaru Legacy 2.5i premium.	First step to make your car a "sleeper" is gonna be a turbo engine swap.  I don't know  what you think you can get out of just a tune, but all you can really do on a naturally aspirated engine is adjust fueling and ignition timing, and neither of those will accomplish a noticeable increase in power.  If you don't want to engine swap but want power, you're going to be looking at heads and cams, which are pricey, won't deliver as much performance as a stock turbo engine, and hurt streetability.  And a fast Legacy isn't really gonna be a "sleeper" anyway, since those were available from the factory with a turbo so anyone seeing your car will suspect you just slapped the wrong badges on it.  Furthermore, if you want a turbo Legacy, I can just about guarantee it'll be a lot cheaper in the end for you to sell yours and buy a turbo version than to engine swap it.	I want to create a sleeper	You can “tune” any car- they all have ECU’s. The question is - as you stated - if the software exists to modify the oem ecu. Sports car tuning exists since there is a demand for it, so products to interpret and modify ecus have been made. The same cannot be said for a lot of cars since the demand to modify most vehicles is low. HP tuners can tune some Subaru’s, but the legacy isn’t listed. You could call them or ECUFlash and ask. I do have to ask - what makes you want to tune the Legacy ECU?	None	0

I'm always rooting for the Pats but when it became clear we were out of it, made it easy to focus on the Bucs the last few weeks.	Happy for Tom no doubt, just find it really cringeworthy to see the amount of Brady stans that just abandoned ship this past season for the Bucs.

Idk, I would kinda prefer if you still kept to the rules the same way. I subbed to this sub because I wanted to see ContraPoints-related content, I think some others did so as well.  If I wanted to see leftist, US-related stuff, I would go for them to other subs... I think it's okay that the sub is a bit inactive due to the lack of Nat's content, but I wouldn't worry about it, the moment she posts a new video the activity will skyrocket.	If you see something off-topic, report it, and we'll apply our Formula™ to determine if it stays up.  ---  But seriously - when Natalie hasn't put out a video (except a PSA) in 3 months, we relax the standards a lot.

gjrir2p	Efilism: a parody of anti-natalism or serious(ly bad) philosophy?	I agree and that sounds like a definition-consistent assessment.  The way I see it, the groups of individuals I see interact with the hangout subreddit are those who believe, separately:  - that birth is okay (okay here meaning positive or neutral)  Vs  - that some categories of human birth is wrong while others are okay  Vs  - that all human birth is wrong but otherwise birth is okay.  Vs  - that all birth is wrong but otherwise hassening life's end isn't a good thing  Vs  - that all birth is wrong and finding the strength to end life is the next best thing to preventing it  And  For each of the above, a subdivision of whether that belief holds for under only certain conditions (i.e. would change in a utopia) or whether they are on principle and immutable.	Maybe Im misunderstanding, but to me, it sounds like:   >one who also believes that ending existing sentient life should be sought after   Is pro-mortalism   And  >one who believes that current life should take its natural course until death eventually catches up  Is antinatalism	> he argument for anti-natalism already extends to all sentient life  So, I'd like to talk about two things that stem from this.  1)  just to confirm for consistency. If the above holds true, you'd agree that:  - "Sentiocentric" antinatalism is really just antinatalism  - "Anthropocentric" antinatalism is actually natalism coupled with specism  2) how would you go about distinguishing between these two antinatalists, both of whom believe no sentient life should continue to procreate: one who also believes that ending existing sentient life should be sought after and one who believes that current life should take its natural course until death eventually catches up.

gjrivns	Slayer's Dave Lombardo Shares Opinion on Metallica's Lars Ulrich	&gt;The fact is, Lars is responsible for some of the most memorable drum parts in metal (like the machine gun double bass part in One)...  I agree. Just with this one thing, I wanted to point out that Dark Angel’s Gene Hoglan did it first in 1986’s *Darkness Descends*	It is fair to say that Lars, in the grand scheme of heavy metal drummers, ranks lower when it comes to technical skills, especially compared to the likes of Lombardo or Menza, and his drumming has only gotten lazier and sloppier with time.  However, the drumming on the first four albums, especially AFJA, was pretty solid.  The fact is, Lars is responsible for some of the most memorable drum parts in metal (like the machine gun double bass part in One) and he is absolutely indispensable to the songwriting process with James.  Lars, Kirk and even Cliff have all been criticized for their technical skills, but their creativity, along with James (who is an excellent songwriter and rhythm guitarist), was what made Metallica the greatest metal band of all time, not their chops.	I’m not a musician so bear with me here. Why the constant debate about Lars’ skills? If a successful band in any genre was based only on the very best technical players there would only be a handful of bands out there to listen to right?	None	0

All my life I've been interested in wearing goth/emo/punk clothes (without being interested in their actual sub-culture) but only now I am actually willing to try it out for good. Bought some edgy clothes that I wear when I'm on my own but would never dare to show them to anyone. Experimenting with these kind of outfits seems more like something to do at 14 or 16, not 24.

I've drank pure sugar maple sap before and it tastes like maple-y water. It's really nothing to write home about. All other maples have much lower sugar content in their sap so I'm betting they really wouldn't taste like much at all, maybe a little bit treeish. Go ahead and drink it, just don't expect much.

Sugar maples have a very pointy, dark colored bud, while silver maples are much rounder, (like a  cluster of bubbles kind of) and lighter color, like a red.

gjsl32d	Raising minimum wage debate in America	Why are you comparing apples to horse shit?   Why dont you compare US to US 60-70 years ago? Right because it wouldn't fit your narrative (or should i say Koch&amp;billionaire friends think tanks narrative to be more precise)	Spain is just a single example of how increased minimum wage as actually widened the economic wealth gap. Sweden and Italy are also examples of how increased minimum wage have left the lower class stranded. As minimum wage increases, costs will also begin to increase. To keep their same margins, prices increase. The crunch wrap supreme is an elementary example, a more real example would be the price of renting a home! There are alternatives, but increased minimum wage is a failed method. We can just learn from other countries and find a communal solution!	Im from Spain and i can say the Minimum payment laws dont work and are so bad  For example in Spain the Minimum payment are 900€ (in Spain is too much to a Minimum payment) then if you are Work before the law for 700€ you become unployment because your job now is  ilegal and you get now 0€  No for nothing Spain have a +/- 35% of unployment rate  (Also sorry for my bad English 😅)	The 60s? GDP had healthy growth rates, as did wages. The issue is raising the minimum along with unhealthy GDP growth. The US hasn’t seen that growth since 2014 which was the dramatic rebound following the bottom of the 2008 recession in 2012. GDP contracted 3.2% in 2020 (for obvious reasons).

So now you have to figure out how to detect them again. Basically an arms race.	Wow, that makes sense. That's terrible. Google should work on filtering out bad content. Maybe run it through an algorithm or something. And if it's bad, push it to the end of the queue. Maybe some day.

gjsyq84	My face every time I get a youtube ad about raycon and their "premium" sound	I haven't heard of them before (not readily available in Australia it looks like) and I just looked them up on Amazon US, and they seem to have overwhelmingly positive reviews there??  Also, a search on Reddit turned up [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/9vdbjx/the_raycon_true_wireless_e50/) and people seem to be talking positively about them.  So what's the story - what happened to them?	I bought them without looking up reviews, listened for about 5 seconds before I put them back in the box and initiated a return. It was bad lol.	I'll be honest, before I ever knew anything about audio, I was tempted by the Raycon ads... I mean... If all my favorite youtubers are recommending them, they must be good right?	I think the majority of listeners aren't super critical in their listening habits and just think massive bass = high quality sound especially with most pop music.  The reviews could also be gamed like some of the other products on Amazon, but not sure.  The DankPods video on YouTube goes them in hilarious detail, and the frequency curve is *FAR* from flat. Massive bass (like +20dB up until 500 Hz), no mids, and a spike to +20dB at 6000 Hz.  It sounded like I was playing music in another room with my ear pressed up against the wall. The call quality was awful too.	0
gjtcx55	Do You Ever See A Cute Outfit, Try To Replicate It And End Up Hating It On Yourself? How Did You Fix That? Did You Ever Get The Answer As To Why It Didn't "Look Right" On You?	I'm super skinny, and I find that oversized silhouettes look good on me, as long as there's some aspect of the outfit that looks purposefully tailored/sized appropriately. For instance, if I'm wearing a looser, flowy sweater, the sleeves will be more form-fitting to avoid the illusion I just grabbed something random that was three sizes too big. I also tend to do the oversized top / form-fitting pants combo, or vice versa, because that makes the outfit feel more "balanced" to me.	As an extremely skinny person, oversized silhouettes look awful on us too! Just make it stop. Im so sick of that style.	A lot of contemporary fashion is made for extremely skinny bodies. A lot of they styles are just super unfriendly to curves. Oversized silhouettes just make larger people look awful most of the time.  My personal solution to this is to not give a fuck about modern fashions. I work a lot more with vintage styles which tend to be quite friendly to curvy bodies. Structured fitted garments work better with larger bodies.   I also tailor a lot of my clothes to my size. Find a tailor you like. Talk to them about adjusting clothes so that they hit the right places on you. Having the waistband in the right place will likely work wonders. Having a full bust adjustment so that clothes will fit both bust and waist properly should help with emphasizing that you're busty and not just fat.  So yeah look at vintage styles and find a good tailor.	None	0
gjtn7dd	[Star Wars] Prophecy or not, it is confirmed a few times. Anakin has more raw potential in the force than anyone ever. So why was his upbringing in the council so mundane? why didn't he have a multitude of teachers? special resources, etc. The council effectively had a force Nuke.	&gt; The Jedi don't 'dissociate with their emotions'.  If no one takes one that is struggling emotionally seriously, or makes a safe environment for them to express their emotions, that encourages dissociation.  The Jedi tried to teach that you should not grow to love someone enough that you wish to marry them, or have children, the only notable exception being Ki Adi Mundi, but that was due to some of the details with his species either having a very, very low birth rate or a very low population, I can't remember which.  Being happy, sad, or frustrated isn't really evidence to disprove dissociation from other important emotions, or internalizing them which makes it unhealthy.  This is what happened to Anakin.  No one besides Palpatine or Padme really bothered to even give Anakin a safe place to express the emotions he had, which is one of the things Qui-Gon would have been better able to provide.  Obi-Wan too, had trouble dealing with Satine's death, he had trouble dealing with leaving her behind.  Yes, the Jedi *wanted* to achieve control over their emotions, but what they taught did not adequately convey the lessons that needed to be taught to show someone how to properly deal with emotions like pain, regret, or fear, otherwise there'd be far fewer fallen apprentices.  Controlling emotions too much, not letting people be able to understand how to deal with their fears or concerns is one of the major problems of the Jedi Order.  &gt; The problem with Anakin is that he was taken in when he was too old   No, this is disproven by Luke and Leia, an older student *can learn* to control themselves, and they're usually going to be a little more mature, to understand some of life's greater pleasures and how to deal with loss a little more readily.  Anakin being "too old" was just sheer dogma, and as a result, Qui-Gon rejected it, and was rejected by the council for that, and other beliefs of his.    He needed a father figure, someone who could teach him properly to deal with his emotional trauma instead of burying it under control.  You cannot control something that you haven't learned how to handle properly yet, so as a result, Anakin started looking for someone that could handle that aspect, and share some understanding, like Palpatine instantly understanding Anakin's anger at being on the Council, but not being a Master yet, or how he wasn't trusted to lead certain things, albiet with a very destructive agenda in mind.  He still allowed Anakin to feel something and to control it, that's why he developed such a bond with Palpatine too.	The Jedi don't 'dissociate with their emotions'. The Jedi of the prequels express emotions - we see them happy, sad, frustrated, and relieved. What is vital for a Jedi is being in control of their emotions and not being governed by them, because beings with Force powers who are emotionally unstable can be incredibly dangerous to themselves and others, and that's before you get into the idea that unbridled emotion is a path to the dark side.  The problem with Anakin is that he was taken in when he was too old and therefore he didn't have what I imagine would be fundamental training in emotional control and discipline that initiates get, so despite what the Jedi were trying to teach him, he always had trouble controlling his emotions.	The Jedi also do not understand how to properly deal with emotional trauma anymore.  About 1,000 years passed between the last war between the Jedi and the Sith, and the Jedi started to dissociate more and more with their emotions, to the point where pretty much the only thing that was acceptable to express around other Jedi was a bit of light joking.  Anakin needed a teacher which could help him process the anger so that he was drawing from the living force.  The only one able to do that was Qui-Gon.	Dealing with loss and the negative emotions that come with it is something that the Jedi did indeed deal with - a key Jedi philosophy, based on the Buddhist concept of impermanence, is the idea that everything passes in and out of life, and a Jedi needs to be able to let go of attachments and move on. This was a mindset that needed to be established early in life, and was another thing Anakin lacked. George Lucas himself said it in the commentary to *AotC* when Anakin finds Shmi:  > This is obviously a very pivotal scene for Anakin because this is reuniting with his mother and his youth and at the same time dealing with his inability to let go of his emotions and allow himself to accept the inevitable. The fact that everything must change and things come and go through his life and that he can't hold onto things, which is a basic Jedi philosophy that he isn't willing to accept emotionally and the reason that is is because he was raised by his mother rather than by the Jedi. If he'd have been taken, you know, in his first year and started to study to be a Jedi, he wouldn't have this particular connection as strong as it is and he'd have been trained to love people but not to become attached to them. But he has become attached to his mother and he will become attached to Padme and these things are, for a Jedi, who needs to have a clear mind and not be influenced by threats to their attachments, a dangerous situation. And it feeds into fear of losing things, which feeds into greed, wanting to keep things, wanting to keep his possessions and things that he should be letting go of.   This is what Yoda is talking about in *RotS* when he tells Anakin that he needs to be able to let go of what he fears to lose.	0
