But to say currency as a medium of exchange is *impossible* without government is just incorrect, since it’s already existed without governments at several points in history. Governments *add* to the perceived value of a currency, but they don’t create the value.

It also puts such checks in one section (the front). What remains then tends toward ""happy path"" code that is a more straightforward statement of intent.

391,e26z1oe,CMV: It is morally okay for me to eat meat even though I think it is morally wrong to eat meat,"How does something being on a ""different level of morally bad"" turn a poor justification/rationalization into a good one?

The reasons you gave are not logical or rational or reasonable. Some are perfect examples of logical fallacies. They don't work any better for minor wrongs than they do for major ones.

The Argumentum ad populum fallacy (""Everyone I know does it"") is still a logical fallacy whether it applies to lying or terrorism or littering. Same for the Appeal To Tradition fallacy.
","I see where you are going, but bad example. There are different levels of morally bad and I don't think suicide bombings and eating meat are even close to the same level of bad. I gave the example of lying about how a pie tastes above. That would be similar in my mind. Rewrite your little scenario:

> I think it is morally wrong to lie about things and won't change my view on that. Despite believing that, I still lie about liking my mom's pie. Everyone I know lies about little things like that. I was raised doing that. My significant other lies to me about whether or not she can tell I lost weight. To avoid supporting lying would make my life significantly more difficult. I don't know how to live life without telling at least small lies. My mom would be crushed if she found out I hated her pie. ","If someone else engaged in a different immoral behavior but for the exact same reasons that you do, would you think they are justified? For example:

> I think it is morally wrong to engage in suicide bombing of innocent civilian targets and won't change my view on that. Despite believing that, I still support suicide bombings of innocent civilians. Everyone I know supports suicide bombers. I was raised supporting terrorists. My significant other is a bomb maker. To avoid supporting terrorism would make my life significantly more difficult. I don't know how to live life without helping to commit violent terrorist acts. I would need a separate religion from my family. Etc.

If such reasons are insufficient justification for other immoral behavior, why is it ok for any immoral behavior?",None,0,,,Lying is sometimes morally justified
