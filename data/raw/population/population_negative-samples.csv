eeq7092	Conor McGregor has not won a fight in over two years, how is he still 10th in the pound for pound rankings?	P4P is only weighted by current activity. 	Well considering he has only had one mma fight in those two years, the other boxing which doesnt involve those p4p rankings. You have to remember that as a featherweight he moved up and put on arguably one of the most dominant championship performances of all time. Before that he fought Diaz and before that recorded the fastest knockout in a championship match. Thats why he is still on the rankings and very much deserves to be. If it wasnt for Mcgregor the sport wouldnt be nearly as popular. Really hasnt done anything to be removed from it.  Also he was the first double champ in history.	None	None	0
efguqck	Christianity requires one to believe so much more than Buddhism does, meaning that Christianity is less likely to be true than Buddhism.	I want to preface this by saying I think we both agree that the original post is overreaching in in its application of Occam's Razor, but I think your rebuttal to it may be flawed.  &amp;#x200B;  In terms of assumptions required, the belief that quantum mechanics or evolution are true and the belief that peanuts are real actually require essentially the same amount of **assumptions**. The only core assumption we really need to make in either case is that we the validity of repeated observation can be relied upon. That is to say if we observe something occurring repeatedly and it is confirmed by others also observing it, then we can reasonably conclude the observed event (or object) is actually occurring/existing. Let me be clear that I understand this is not an epistemic truth, I am aware and am calling it an assumption on purpose, but this is the only core assumption required to get either belief off the ground. The distinction lies in that once you grant this assumption and see a few peanuts your work is done in the latter case, while the former requires a far more substantial and lengthy period of gathering, collating, processing and interpreting the gathered evidence in order to formulate the stated conclusions about quantum physics or evolution. One you have done so however, the core **assumption** required was the same in both cases.	Sorry, but I think there's some fundamentally faulty reasoning there. The belief that quantum physics or evolution is true requires infinitely more assumptions that the belief that peanuts are real. Should we conclude that evolution is false...beaten by a nut? Occam's Razor is a general principle, not a truism.	None	None	0

America hasn't killed 60 million of its own people for disagreeing with the government. America hasn't had a major famine due to poor government management of crops.

eg9jji0	What are our thoughts on r/AskHistorians?	I read the post title and just immediately noped the fuck out.   The comments are gonna make me hurl. Thanks	Not only do they not call out propaganda, they actually promote it. Check out [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7vhovy/in_the_gulag_archipelago_solzhenitsyn_describes/) where the top comment with 400+ votes is completely unsourced and essentially just a long way of saying yes whilst providing no actual evidence, and every comment casting doubt on its validity or calling for more evidence has just been removed.	They do not call out propaganda. I am on there and claim some authority as a historian (getting my PhD in historical musicology) but I often see myself as the only voice against Cold War propaganda. It's kind of rough. 	None	0

Star Lord gets all upset and yells because his girlfriend is dead.... coulda easily brought her back the moment the glove was off Thanos' hand. Thor not aiming for Thanos' shoulder/arm/wrist is complete garbage. He's a demi-god who can wield thunder, but can't think "Hm, we need the Gauntlet more than we need Thanos dead." You are able to basically bury your axe in his fucking neck, when he has all the stones, but you can't think ahead to even ATTEMPT to chop off his arm. Fuck off. Now, I'll say this, I enjoyed Infinity War. But, I can't get past those two in particular.	Do you mind  naming some of them?	Marvel heroes and Thanos.

Not me, my mom and her mom. It was my HS graduation party and we had watermelon because I really like watermelon. Well, my mom asked me how I wanted it sliced, and I like the pizza slices. My grandma comes to me later and asks me if she can cut one as a bowl and cube the inside, using the shell as a bowl. I tell her I prefer the pizza slices, but I said we could do one half of the melon one way and the other half the other way. She gets all excited and she leaves. Half hour later my mom and my grandmother are yelling at each other about the watermelon and how to cut it. I walk into the kitchen and my grandmother yells "Tell your mother you told me you wanted it cut my way!" and I just turn around and walk away.	None	0

en0hcry	(Spoilers Main) Why did winter not come in King‘s Landing?	Fair enough, but it is visually inconsistent with snow in King's Landing at the end of Season 7. It's definitely believable for more tropical climates, but that's not King's Landing.	Maybe it is just that I come from a subtropical location, but Kings Landing did look wintery to me in season 8.  In previous seasons the outside of KL looked very green. It this season it is very dry and devoid of vegetation, which is how many winter is in many non-temperate climates. Not all places have lots of snow during winter.  &#x200B;  And I think they also choose to not make it all snowy to make it visually distinct from the northern episodes.	None	I think you’re both right but only because they didn’t really indicate winter in other ways. Winter doesn’t mean constant snow on the ground obviously, so the lack of snow is fine. But only if they reinforce narratively that it is winter. Have cersei and Qyburn share a line while the peasants pour into the keep about food concerns or something.	0

en1s2fb	Putting Prounouns in your bio is more of a statement of your politics than anything else	Oh, you're in for a treat. You know how there are two genders? Well, forget that.  Some people unironically believe that gender is a social construct and a spectrum. They believe that you can determine your own gender and that you can change your gender at will if you feel like a different gender.  I'm not joking.  The rabbit hole goes [even deeper](https://www.etsy.com/shop/TuckBuddies). Yes, you are reading this right, they sell underwear for "transitioning children". And don't even get me started on people wanting to give their kids hormonal suppressants... some truly are not fit to be parents.	What the fuck is "cisgendered"?

en8dr30	(Spoilers Extended) Benioff on Cersei	I mean, I appreciate what you're doing trying to explain this away, but the main difference between her ordering an assassin to kill Tyrion in Winterfell and her ordering a soldier to kill Tyrion outside King's Landing is whether or not she sees it.   If that's an issue, can't she just walk away and order her soldiers to do it while she's not looking?	>  And thats not even considering that Cersei is the most ruthless character in the entire show, who's main arc for most of it has been to KILL TYRION. She even sent an assassin to do it in the SAME EPISODE. For absolute fucking shame.  I dont have a problem with that. I interpreted it as shes willing to be ruthless so long as she doesnt have to do it herself, and her seeing her brother in person made her hesitate to do it. She has a single minded goal and then when it is in her grasp, she cant bring herself to do it.  It may be just plot armour, but again I dont have a problem with that aspect. It actually makes it more believable when characters arent one dimensional and single minded, which is refreshing in contrast to what D&D did to most of the characters.  I mean, she also ordered Jaime killed but we dont expect to see her have Jaime killed on the spot when she actually sees him in person, theres just too much emotional baggage.	Tyrion trying to reason with his sister wasnt completely unbelievable....but Cersei sparing him was IMO the biggest sin the show has committed. Cersei had all the leverage, nothing to lose, and absolutely no reason not to kill him.  And thats not even considering that Cersei is the most ruthless character in the entire show, who's main arc for most of it has been to KILL TYRION. She even sent an assassin to do it in the SAME EPISODE. For absolute fucking shame.	> If that's an issue, can't she just walk away and order her soldiers to do it while she's not looking?  No, it’s not about whether or not she sees it, it’s I just saw him and I can’t bring myself to do it anymore. It’s the context of the situation. It’s much easier to order the killing of someone when they’re far away and you vaguely remember that you’re supposed to hate them vs you just saw him and potentially want to hear what he has to say.	0

Yeah, it's another instance of D&D stupidly assigning modern values into the Game of Thrones world.

What I need anders to: Why doesnt Sansa pardon Jon? Shes queen of the north after all...   Why does no one (especially Dorn who was the last kingdom do be pet of the seven) not demand to be a separate kingdom as well?  Has no one told Greyworm of the Butterly Fever?   Why does bran need a master of whispers?  Why did the wildlings wait for Jon before going North,  how would they have know hed be coming?	None	1. yeah, but I mean, once they departed from Kong’s Landing and Greyworm having saild to naath 3. fair point  5. but even then, I’d have expected them to just walk straight through.

eobsgsj	Searching through someone's post history to use it against them is one of the most lowly thing you can do on reddit.	&gt; Well, you're assuming liberals aren't completely stupid  It would be a correct assumption. Right wingers generally tend to be less intelligent than left wingers. A study by Hodson &amp; Busseri (2012) on the relationship between affiliation for "right-wing" politics and general intelligence reveals that right wingers on aggregate are less intelligent than left wingers. This is consilient with other measurable behavioral patterns, notably the strong link between conscientiousness and right-wing beliefs (Hirsh; DeYoung; Xiaowen &amp; Peterson, 2010) and notable correlation between conscientiousness and lower intelligence (Moutafi, Furnham &amp; Paltiel, 2004).

Living to 78 means your lifespan would be higher. Probably 90 or something.	None	> just because you lived to 78 doesn't mean you'll live to 79  Surely you see that living to 78 is \*correlated\* with living to 79 though. Doing the one makes it much more likely you'll do the other.	0
erry0x3	CMV:Neither of the 2020 candidates will be the de facto president	OK, yes that's how statistics work. As I mentioned in another comment the mode is more useful.	You're basing your argument on life expectancy and it seems clear to me that you really don't understand how it's calculated at all. Life expectancy used to be around 30 and as low as early 20s in some places. People weren't dropping dead at age 20 or 30 though. If half the people die upon birth and half die at age 60 you'll have a life expectancy of 30 even though no one is actually dying at that age. That's a simplistic example, but it demonstrates the flaw in your logic. The real point to consider is that your individual life expectancy goes up as you live longer. The life expectancy for a nation is made up of aggregate percentages of people who die at age 1, age 2, age 3 etc. If you make it to 75 than all the percentage chance of dying before that age becomes 0 since it didn't actually materialize. You're the lucky one who avoided all the possible ways to die before that age. So on average you will live longer than the average person being born at the current moment.	None	You put the mode as being above the current age any contender would end 2 terms at, so i think that by your own admission your argument doesn't hold water	0

For one Biden had an aneurysm, and I'm not sure if Sanders has anything but I doubt it would be made public knowledge.	Why is Trump's claim dubious? Has he missed any rallies recently?

ery0h5e	For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died. ~ Romans 7:9	Yes and no, the commandment about praising sabbath is not in use for people who are under the Grace.	I think.... taking that to mean that the Ten Commandments are themselves bad is quite a stretch. Certainly, the Mosaic law is for the most part fulfilled by Christ, but the Ten Commandments all seem to be clearly part of the moral law and therefore still in force, not because they are there written but because they fall under love of God and neighbor	None	Well Hebrews 4 tell us that there is a sabbath for us in the new testament, which is the rest from our works in Jesus Christ.  In other words, honoring the sabbath is equivalent with believing on Jesus Christ, and so is still a relevant commandment.  Though we're free to esteem any day above another or every day alike.	0

eupvn85	The government should legalize all (narcotic) drugs	I don't think that's what was being said in the post.

I believe that the cost government would tax the sale of these things, not sell it themselves.  I guess it would be sold in dispensaries like weed is in many places.	So how is the government going to compete with normal narcotics dealers?  Give away drugs for free?  That's going to be costly and inefficient.  People will need to be taxed a lot more to fund that.  Ironically, this provides an incentive to start using drugs since you're paying for them anyway, and they might take your mind off your new government-imposed financial woes.	yes, that is the other half my argument. if this were not the case, drugs would not be a problem. they would be easy to get rid of if they didn't solve problems (value). this is how most people get hooked onto drugs: they solve some kind of problem for them.  you seem strangely interested in taking points out of context...	0

That is just placing the air	None	None	0
ev8592y	CMV: Being able to stop time is worthless at best.	Assuming that you could you would create an immediate vacuum of where the object was previously, that could not be filled until time was unstopped as well as compressing the space around it. In reality,  the particles couldn't move; they would neither fill vacuums nor be compressible, you would be locked in position because time does not exist to enable them to move.	Well there would be two reasons I could think of:  The first: If you were able to reach out and move something that was 'halted' in time, consider what would happen when you *unpaused* time. That object will have moved from point A to point B instantaneously, at such an absurd speed as to be unmeasurable. The amount of friction that would generate would either light the atmosphere on fire or cause some sort of insane release of energy on a scale with an atomic bomb.  Alternatively, if time is stopped and things are 'time locked' to avoid the above issue, there is no amount of force you could exert that would be able to move an object. You would essentially trap yourself in a cage of air.  There are still things you could do with either of those versions of stopping time, depending on circumstances, but I'd say the second version is infinitely preferable to the first even though on the surface it seems much less useful.	Why can’t I move the air around me? That isn’t creating time. That is just placing the air	I definitely agree that trapping yourself in a cage of air is a more reasonable outcome. It's also just much less interesting in most cases, so I also understand why this is almost never the version of 'stopped time' used by any story.	0
ev88vtp	CMV: Being able to stop time is worthless at best.	Assuming that you  are talking about the 4th dimension as time,you would have to stop other objects movement in time (not your own as that would paralyze you). I did make an error in thinking that the universe would exist at all if time was stopped, all objects are 4 dimensional if you remove that property they cease to exist not just in 4-D but at all.	>as that would cause motion, creating time.  Not really how it works. We *measure* motion as a function of time, but time is really just a dimension in which things exist. What you're doing is altering an objects spacial coordinates without altering it's temporal coordinates. When you stop time, you're simply stopping your own movement in the temporal dimension while continuing to move in all spacial dimensions.	None	Stopping an object's movement in time does not remove it's property of being fourth dimensional any more than stopping an object's movement in space does.	0

There is no way to deny it.	Saturated fat is chemically the stablest. Polyunsaturated fat is the least stable.  The hype about saturated fat raising cholesterol, and cholesterol being bad, is unfounded. Things that lower cholesterol, including polyunsaturated fat, generally don't lower mortality rates. Cholesterol was a red herring.	Lifelong exposure to LDL is what causes atherosclerosis. Taking a snapshot of cholesterol levels two times in 80 years for a disease that occurs over decades is not very useful	0

eyq6sdi	Saturated Fat Is More Metabolically Harmful for the Human Liver Than Unsaturated Fat or Simple Sugars [overfeeding study; n=38] (2018)	Is it not common sense that a visibly obese person's fat cells have been insufficiently insulin resistant whilst he's been gaining weight. It strikes me as obvious.	Can you cite any studies to back up your assertion?	This study fails to understand itself.  Take already obese people, force them to overeat, observe where the extra fat is stored.   Which is healthier:  A) the already obese person continues to store more fat in the already overly full fat cells; or  B) the already obese person's body recognises it has too much fat stored in its fat cells and therefore ends up storing it elsewhere.  Well, the answer is probably A, but in the real world where we're not forcing people to overeat, you'd prefer B because that would trigger a satiety signal, preventing overeating and eventually causing weightloss.   If saturated fat is triggering insulin resistance in fat people's fat cells - that's a good thing!! It means they'll stop overeating. But the nutritional world is so bias against saturated fat that they utterly fail to see the woods for the trees.	That’s not how any of this works. You make observations. Come up with theories then test them. The plural of anecdotes isn’t data.   I’m still curious though; study after study says that saturated fat is bad yet there is a fat fan base that claim saturated fat is also healthy.

Tyrannical governments don't form spontaneously, it's not a handful of people that "seize power and rule with an iron fist" that's just lazy history and story-telling.

Alberta being a one party state is a perverse incentive for their government, they have no real reason to seek workable solutions for the Alberta economy.

f7dlwb2	Major Bolivian opposition figure Fernando Camacho puts a Bible on a Bolivian flag in Morales' residence. Before he leaves, he declares "Pachamama", an Andean indigenous goddess, "will never return to the Palace." He then says, "Bolivia belongs to Christ."	Seems to me people here are supporting the message and the sentiment, not the person saying it—who most of us know little about.   I know, I know, it’s a novel idea.	It's amazing how easy it is to get people on the internet to support you by just doing a symbolic gesture. They won't even look into what you actually stand for, or anything. Just put a Bible on a flag, and *voil* - instant support.	None	I get what you are saying, but be very careful with this. This defense of Christianity is often mingled with racism in Bolivia. Evo Morales is not someone I'm rushing to defend for many, many, *many* reasons, but he is someone who stood for indigenous rights after centuries of neglect. On the other hand, [this](https://twitter.com/telesurenglish/status/1194493423270744064?fbclid=IwAR2ha9xsvBTFx6xBfXikM73YLJLWdeHhmzQp1jp_rAZQbw2x0Ks9dukOrSs) is the current president of Bolivia.

f84bv1l	Andrew Scheer is not on a published list of former U.S. citizens	Lots of politicians see it as a conflict of interest.   The main problem is that conservatives, and Scheer himself, have outed Liberal MPs as dual citizens and forced them to renounce through public shaming. This was just for serving as MPs. This guy was running for PM.   As if American Andy wasn't enough of a hypocrite.	Could someone explain why Scheer holding dual citizenship is such a big deal?

faod17h	McConnell: 'No Chance' Senate Will Remove Trump From Office	FYI, Trump's approval rating is not 52%. There was one polling institute that find that number in a couple polls and Trump simply spread that as far as possible, while ignoring all of the polls that disagree with this figure. 538 average has his approval/disapproval at 41.9/53.2%.   https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/	>Democrat and Senate Majority leader Obstructo Mac'Pantswagon: 'No Chance' Senate will remove President Murderizer from office over 'unfounded claims' of revoking gun rights, Republicans unable to impeach President Murderizer due to Senate impasse, gun rights forever revoked as a result.  That's not an alternate dimension, *that's the future*. The Senate now is setting the precedent that in the face of clear constitutional and legal violations, a sitting president can't be impeached because fifty two people think he's *"a pretty cool dude."*  Republicans are too busy thinking of the now, in an age where *everyone* can see it. They're intoxicated with the buzz, and completely ignoring the massive political hangover they're going to be feeling once Trump is out of office.	Somewhere, in an alternative universe...  > Senate Majority leader Chuck Schumer: 'No Chance' Senate will remove Hillary Clinton from office  I wonder how this sub is reacting to *that*, in that alternative universe.

Like bro I'm a fucking high school student I'm not writing a hit piece.   It shouldn't even be that tough of a question,  this is the party that constantly talks about middle class issues. I'm an impressionable, young, lower class student about to go into debt for years fucking humor me at least.	What's the matter, Jean?

The extensive US investigation into Huawei, including Meng Wanzhou has been been in the works for 12 years.  The idea that this is something Trump on his own, suddenly cooked up, is asinine.

Hmmm, I'm not one to judge but given the fact on how liberal Spain is right now with lots of socialism, I have some doubts if he really is catholic. I could be wrong and I'll shut my mouth about the topic.	None	But why didn't the previous Kings and he continued the policies from Franco's Regency. The economy was catholic and not modern liberal-capitalism, and also why not make it a traditional monarchy instead of a Liberal Parliamentary Monarchy?

fc0cqr7	Russia has successfully tested its sovereign internet, a country-wide alternative to the global internet, its government has announced.	Iran’s uranium enrichment program was crippled via cyber attack (arguably the first cyber attack in the world) and those centrifuges were on their own intranet.   Retaliation is well within the realm of possibility.	Now they can launch cyber attacks Without Fear of retaliation	None	That’s true, but one of the lessons we learned from the Stuxnet attack is that it actually takes tons of resources to achieve an attack that is that successful. It took dedicated teams from both the NSA and Mossad to develop and involved about 4 zero days (unused, never seen before vulnerabilities) to work. I also believe that Mossad’s major contribution was to have an inside source deliver it via flash drive. These attacks may get easier as we invest more, but I feel that the easiness of cyber offense is slightly overblown when it comes to these large, very effective attacks.	0

There are over 4,000 different deities that have been sincerely worshipped by groups of humans, and that doesn't even count sub-denominations. Many of those gods are mutually exclusive with the christian god, meaning only one can be true and you have to worship the right one - out of thousands - or you're screwed for all eternity.

Without delving too far into political discussion/argument at this stage - we need strong leadership with goals that align with the UN sustainable development goals. I'm willing to attend peaceful demonstrations regarding this - hopefully, there will be something on a Saturday this year.	None	Forgive me for being slightly sceptical of data from BP. I'm sure that is accurate to some extent.  Australia and the USA are leading the world in per capita emissions.  I am aware that there are many local initiatives being led in the USA, independent of their national leadership.  The President appointing a climate change denier to Head of the EPA is hardly something we should be replicating.  I'd like to avoid this devolving into a trump discussion.  This worldwide problem requires worldwide cooperation towards common goals.  If the USA and Australia reduce CO2 in the long term, and don't shift emission production offside etc- it's a good thing I agree.	0

Just because our waste isn’t visible, doesn’t mean we are clean. We waste a lot. Our carbon use per capita is higher than almost all other nations  Well I could be wrong, let's examine a couple of maps of different emissions PM2.5 and CO2 (includes natural emissions)—and see how Australia is doing.  https://i.imgur.com/VwAbmSQ.jpg  https://i.imgur.com/Yl4FM8A.jpg  I don't know about you, but I'd rather be in Australia than China according to that map. I can go outside and breath some great fresh air, even in the city. Also let's think of the plants that produce our oxygen and not reduce CO2 too much—since that's what plants breath.	How is Australia one of the cleanest places on the planet? Just because our waste isnt visible, doesnt mean we are clean. We waste a lot. Our carbon use per capita is higher than almost all other nations	Australia is one of the cleanest places on the planet—and we all want to keep it that way—just remember that pissing people off and blocking traffic is not going to get them on your side.	China has a population of over 1 Billion people, in a space smaller than Aus. Aus has just shy over 25million. China has more populous cities than the whole of Aus put together.   Just because we may not be as bad as the worst omitting countries doesn’t mean we can’t do better.   And per capita we are worse than China with our carbon footprint.  We are 16.8tons per capita and China is 8. That’s twice as bad by my maths	0
fdsnrjq	Australia’s fires have pumped out more emissions than 100 nations combined. Climate change is driving climate change.	Not exactly. No offense to Carl Sagan, but there has been some progress in understanding Venus since his time. Venus, like Mars, has no magnetosphere and loses lighter elements like [hydrogen](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/JA074i016p04178)  to space. However, unlike Mars, Venus is still EXTREMELY volcanically active and it’s believed that Venus’ atmosphere is constantly being replenished with heavier stuff like sulfur and carbon.   We mine/pump our hydrocarbons little by little and then burn them (inefficiently). Venus completely resurfaced itself some hundreds of millions of years ago and continues to slowly resurface itself thru volcanism to this day.	Carl Sagan did a paper on exactly this.

Its running at 2666MHz. RAM Nowadays is Doube-Data Rate (or DDR), so the RAM will always run at half of its advertised speed, but since its double data rate, it gets multiplied by two. (1333 \* 2 = 2666)	You don't need to match the freq exactly. What you don't want to do is to try to run RAM at higher frequencies that it is rated for. I believe that you have 2666 Hz ram already, running at 1333 MHz. Someone else can confirm this.	Yeah, for example, I bought 3200MHz ram, but some apps show it running at 1600.	0

I got it when it first came out, and I'm not crazy about it either honestly.  I think a lot of people struggle with the timing, and that says something about how the game is conveyed to the player that the devs should be aware of...the timing needs to be more obvious.  Yes I know there are people who have it all figured out, and I'm happy for them, but there is a larger than usual number of posts from players who are struggling to grasp how it works.

ffuj8oa	After half an hour of Audica I think I have come to a conclusion about rhythm games	Pistol Whip relies on the player to impose their own rhythm on gameplay. Beat Saber, a fine game to be sure, imposes it's rhythm on the player, locking the player into specific movements at specific times.    Your reasons for playing the game the way You want to are certainly legit, but i think it's "not a rhythm game" only if you don't play it that way.	Pistol whip isnt really a rhythm game, its more of an on rails shooter that happens to have a sound track in the back of every level. I mean you get extra points for shooting on time with the beat but its nowhere near necessary or a core part of the game so I dont think its fair to categorize it as a rhythm game. And in my opinion the best way to play pistol whip is with deadeye mode. Which disables the aim assist. So if you havent played deadeye mode, you havent really played pistol whip	None	None	0

I wouldnt call it evil as much as I call it a severe mental issue. Maybe these people need to be prayed for. We live in weird times folks.	None	Maybe I am just optimistic about mercy, but I think a lot of these people's culpability is pretty diminished based on their illness.

Still would rather Carson be president, but this time I know that Trump has at least done a fair bit of good in office.	Strawman.

finogzn	This Is Why the NRA Hates Gun Violence Research	[States with more gun control have more mass shootings.](https://yeoldmiller.home.blog/2019/12/15/mass-shootings-in-2019/)	The researcher admits they focused on *NRA states  features minimal regulations on firearms.* As well as *blue  features high levels of firearm regulation.* California lays in between counter to the beliefs of many. And I don't see that California has a disproportionate per capita number of mass shootings compared to other states. You'd have to prove that California has a disproportionate number of drug deaths as well. As for homeless deaths. My impression (living here all my life) is that many of the homeless in California are from other states. They come to California when they are half dead from the bad climate and lack of healthcare in other states. But I don't know what any of this has to do with gun politics.	it's convenient they leave California out of it... where some fair amount of those "mass shootings" using "illegal weapons" occur. Or that blue states have large amountd of death by drugs/homelessness. And talk about our side spreading fear? they literally are doing that with this article.	That analysis includes shootouts between gangbangers, policemen injured on-duty, domestic incidents and events where not a single person died. That's a very selective reading of the concept of "mass shooting".	0

The problem with denying cert to the preliminary injunction is that bump stocks are now contraband and anyone in possession either has to destroy them or surrender them or be subject to criminal prosecution.   Now we can all rest assured that all those that were surrendered will be kept safely stored until the case wends its way through the system. /s	Chill the fuck out, everyone.

If the ATF wants to classify bump stocks as firearms, then hundreds of thousands of these "arms" being out there, per Alito's concurrence in Caetano, would make them "in common use for traditionally lawful purposes". I don't see how the ATF could prevail if this is granted cert when it's "ripe". It might even undermine the Hughes Amendment or the NFA itself.	Chill the fuck out, everyone. They denied cert to the preliminary injunction, the case can still proceed through the system and be ruled on the merits. Is it great? No. Is it the end of the world?

fkoev6b	VR Power got really hot in use, smelled like burning plastic, partially melted	i dont think you are capable of discerning whether there is evidence of it being thrown, as opposed to heat damage, or the possible combination of both.  You also accuse them of making assumptions, without realizing you made quite a few yourself.	I think this is a crude statement. Looking at the photo I see zero evidence that this is from being struck or thrown. This looks 100% warped. You can even see the surface area has no scratches or abrasions. Also, completely ignoring that the customer said he smelled burning and it felt hot. Also to just flat out say BEFORE having your hands on it that the heat was normal is laughable. You have no idea how "hot" it was without being there at that moment. I wouldn't buy anything from a company that makes assumptions before ANY sort of hands on with the device.   Another note if the device had gotten hot enough to melt plastic I would have "chucked" it too considering what these batteries can do and how hot they can get when something fails.   The most laughable part of your reply is "VR tends to heighten our senses." Insinuating that him playing VR could be the cause is an absolute joke.   &#x200B;  Extremely poorly handled response. Safety should be #1 concern	Hi this is the manufacturer, Rebuff Reality. We have performed a very extensive testing and validation regimen on VR Power and did not observe this problem. We have requested the unit back from the customer and will have our engineers get to the bottom of this ASAP. Our initial thoughts is the observed dent occurred when the customer "chucked it out my apartment door" and the heat was not anything above normal for a battery. VR tends to heighten our senses.   That being said this is only our initial hypothesis, we do not downplay the possibility there is a manufacturing defect and we will work relentlessly towards finding the cause and a solution soon. If you currently own a VR Power and are experiencing this issue or any other problem please stop using the product immediately and reach out to us at [support@rebuffreality.com](mailto:support@rebuffreality.com)	That's not an assumption. Plastic with that type of rough service if it was caused by being thrown would have SOME sort of abrasion. Anything, some type of small scratches but it does not. That's a warp.

fkyfpus	[DEBATE] Dillahunty Vs Wood -- What Best Explains Ethics, God or Secular Humanism?	Ethics (man's laws) have changed over time. Morality (God's laws) is unwavering.	Morality has changed significantly over history though. This is appealed to whenever the statement is made "but that was the Old Testiment". Whether you believe it to be absolute and supported by some external factor or not, norms of several thousand years ago that were seen as righteous are seen as repugnant now because we as a society have become convinced of various rights, be it human rights, womans rights, animal rights... We collectively learn more about ourselves and the world around us as time goes on and are forced to look at things differently. Where are you seeing stagnant morality through history?	I think it's important to differentiate between *morality* and *ethics*. Morality is an absolute right or wrong. Ethics is what society is willing to accept at the time. Morals have never changed, but ethics have varied greatly over the ages.	So you are just defining morality as unchaining, definitionally.	0

The Pillars were always more popular amongst the tape traders than the Musketeers as I understand it. And I think that it is a fair summary of the situation.   Both groups were absolutely stellar.	New Japan was the far more popular promotion during that time. Multiple huge crowds in Dome shows per year, and outside of Tokyo NJPW had a much larger fanbase than AJPW.

fme0d9j	Zero Fucks Friday (April 3rd 2020)	You "haven't heard this"? Seriously? Are you in a cave with no TV or internet?  Here you go....   https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/opinion/trump-coronavirus.html	What's with the trump comment?  I haven't heard this	Both WWE and AEW should be totally shut down right now. There is no excuse for those companies to continue endangering their talent and crew.  Broken Matt sucks, has always sucked and will always suck.   Jericho's goofy, shitty promos with the drone are another example of how much awful shit he's done in his career. People calling him "the GOAT" are clueless.  The Trump administration is a Keystone Kops operation that has already failed to the point where thousands more people will die than if they hadn't tried to pretend this wasn't a crisis back in January.   Leaving the pandemic to the side for a second, wrestling in front of no crowd is the drizzling shits. It's awful. Stop doing it.  Undertaker needs to go away and not come back. It's embarrassing, and not just in the way his gimmick was always embarrassing.  Stay safe and healthy folks. Stay in your homes, and ignore Trump's daily propaganda/lie performance.	None	0
fmn72kb	Jun Akiyama's response to fan that doesn't want WWE to acquire AJPW	What? While it's true they have stopped growing they aren't in danger of going out of business either.	Ironically, this is the most attention AJPW has had in forever. If they put their foot down and refused to sell, theyd make a lot of people happy...  Who still wont watch the shows and theyll go out of business.   Im holding out hope that someone else swoops in and buys them. But they have to sell, that or theyre done.	None	None	0

fnbbxqr	What is the best place to find a date that isn't a dating site?	There is no free place where everyone is guaranteed to be open to dating. That's where the rejection comes in. We need to be open and fun and light, then approach people In a fun and light manner, ask them for a number, and if they decline, look for someone else that tickles our fancy.	>men without being scary or creepy. Usually, this takes time and many rejections.  I mean yeah of course but, something where people would actually be interested in being approached. I wouldn't say I am a dude that would pick up a date from any girl anywhere but, on the other hand I have done that a few times but, not something I generally like doing.	You can literally find possible dates everywhere there are people. At work, in a library, at the bus station, at a grocery store, etc. (Of course, this is post-virus.)  The problem isn't the location. The problem is the approach. You have to figure out a way to meet women without being scary or creepy. Usually, this takes time and many rejections.	None	0

fo24gnh	We have to wake up: factory farms are breeding grounds for pandemics	You’re almost certainly correct. They didn’t have the high-protein diets to fuel a large forebrain and their abstract thinking ability was probably pretty limited.	Those many millions of years ago when our common primeval proto human ancestor, for whatever reason, ate that first mouthful of meat, I'll bet he could never fathom how evolving away from an all vegetable diet would have such dire consequences so far into the future.	Guarantee most humans who consume meat don’t really want to fathom the fact that it is a possibility. They won’t mentally allow themselves to link covid-19 to “meat” because they believe it came from China so it won’t happen here or they believe it came from China eating dogs/cats/bats/pangolins so they’ll convince themselves of the improbability of that. or they’ll simply say humans require meat to survive and become angry for suggesting an alternative.

foq9zpd	AITA for not 'nurturing' my girlfriend while she's sick?	You can do things on your own when you're dick, no doubt, but it's a tab bit more uncomfortable.   If you cared about someone, you'd try to alleviate that.   It's like she asked you to wipe her ass. You're overreacting.   People get in relationships because they want some sort of support. And it sounds like you don't have much to offer.	I mean she's an adult. Maybe its a difference in how we were taught growing up but in my family if you're sick, you're sick. You still have arms and legs. And that actually makes sense	YTA and it’s not because you don’t want to get sick. You are perfectly justified in not wanting to be around her when she’s sick and could get you sick too. That being said, there are still a million things you could have done to show her some compassion. A good significant other would have gently told her that cuddling wasn’t a good idea, but then would have brought her a comfy blanket, maybe cooked her up some soup, or even just sat in the room with her to keep her company for a while before heading to the living room. Now I’m not saying you two are getting ready to walk down the isle together, but they do say “in sickness and in health” for a reason. You’re meant to care for your partner when they’re sick, not abandon them. That was a wonderful opportunity to show that while you’re logical, you’re also a nurturing, caring individual, and ya blew it. Now go make that girl some tea and kiss her on the head.	The response was to the other guy saying I must make her tea, soup and shit like that.  I support her in other aspects but she knows how I feel about this ONE thing and how much I don't like it. I want to spend time her, trust me, but everyone has their 'no thing'. This is mine	0

fp2nryt	AITA for not wanting to split my inheritance with my sister who my mom disowned after finding out that she is gay and is paying for her girlfriend’s education using my mom’s money?	It's literally in the title of the post and is then referenced numerous times in the post's body and comments.   Homophobia may not be the sole factor, but it very obviously is a factor.	What suggests her sister's sexuality had anything to do with disowning her? It doesn't really seem to factor into this.	ESH.  Your mom was prejudiced.  Your sister is a scammer with an entitlement complex.  And you ... I don't know.  Your inheritance is yours to do with as you please of course.  But I can't escape an icky feeling about this situation.  It feels like you are validating your mom's bigotry, even if you don't intend to do so.    That said I suggest you figure out exactly how much money you are willing to give your sister so she will go away, then find a good lawyer who can put your wishes to work and make sure your assets are protected.	I think the end result is the same. Maybe the mother was homophobic, and maybe if she’d found out her daughter was gay she would’ve just owned her… But the sister decided to be dishonest and scam her mother, so that’s enough justification for not to get any of the money.	0
fp2okr6	AITA for not wanting to split my inheritance with my sister who my mom disowned after finding out that she is gay and is paying for her girlfriend’s education using my mom’s money?	This is, without question, an ESH with the two assholes being OP's sister and mom.   Homophobia isn't suddenly okay just because one particular gay person is trash.   Part of the reason Allie was disowned is because she was gay, which should be reflected in the final judgment, regardless if her being disowned was ultimately justifiable.	NTA.  It was your mom's wishes that it go to you.  Allie scammed your mom out of $70k. She never tried to repair the relationship with her after that and wasn't there for your mom in her life.  So, she has no claim to her property upon death.	None	1. She doesn't get a pass on scamming her mom out of a fortune by being gay.  2. It was Mom's money to do whatever she wanted with. If she would have wanted to leave everything to a charity that reads porn to the blind, that's her prerogative, and Allie isn't entitled to any inheritance her mom doesn't want to give her. She chose to give it to OP.   3. It's OP's money. He has no obligation to give her a dime.   Her argument is "pay me because I'm gay." Nope.	0

fpgvz9b	The design argument	&gt;This argument doesn't entirely prove God, but I believe it wouldn't be a version of atheism worth the name to believe this argument succeeds and still call oneself an atheist. This argument proves a great power operating on the universe, which is unimaginably intelligent. Now those are certainly two traits normally ascribed to God.  I am not the person you were debating with but you really don't seem to understand what you are responding to. You were challenged to support your claim that it is "possible that god could intervene in evolution". Possibility has to be demonstrated and you are just making baseless claims everywhere while showing lack of basic knowledge.  &gt;Really, we know animals evolved by natural selection?  Obviously...  &gt;How do we know how they evolved at all? Were you there?  Evolution was observed countless times. It'a a fact...  &gt;Many scientists would disagree.

You should provide more than cherry picked quote if you are going to provide this as some kind of support (not a very good way to support your argument anyway...).	> You need to show that possibility.

If they came out and admitted their criticisms against past liberal MPs holding dual citizenry was misguided, I think people would be a lot more open to accepting Scheer's dual citizenship and this would not be news.	Calling Scheer out for the hypocrisy at the time the story first broke out was absolutely right because he deserved it. He was wrong to question people's allegiances because of their dual citizenships and it's good that he was caught.  That said, now I'm starting to feel like we are all falling in the same trap. What started as calling out hypocrisy is quickly turning into exactly what he did in the first place: we're all calling him out for being a dual citizen. Is this going to become a thing now?

We went from an early hotspot to a controlled situation where 60,000 people (with nearly 100% wearing masks!!) marched through Seattle yesterday.  But yeah, my little rural WA city is about 20% mask wearers. It's incredibly frustrating.	Ehh I think youre going to find that anywhere to be honest. If anything people were more openly racist when I lived in Philadelphia. Blatantly so, which shocked me as someone who grew up in the south. I was so used to being told southerners were the ones with major race issues. Nope, its everywhere. I lived there during the run up to 2016 and encountered many Trump supporters. I knew more there than I did in NC.   Now Im in Washington and its a little more liberal but not as much as you would think. Unless youre in Seattle proper its the same deal. Every state has its suburbs and tiny towns that have the similar types of people. Most statewide elections are won by razor thin margins in NC so its very much divided. Its also gerrymandered to hell.	It’s because we’re filled with “patriots” who feel their need to get haircuts and manicures is more important than flattening the curve of a deadly virus.

On June 19, 'Juneteenth' he brought the news to to the people of Texas that the Union had won and news of the Emancipation Proclamation (which was made in 1863).  In the years after, Juneteenth became a  celebration in the African-American communities in Texas.  It is the oldest celebration of the end of slavery in the states.

fyznd7w	[USA] "I have a master's degree!"	This is true.  However, as a daily riding motorcyclist for 15 years with no collisions  to my name, the cyclist was riding like a dickhead (I've also been a hardcore cyclist for many years).  This was an obvious "high risk zone" and he should have slowed down to ensure no dickhead drivers were going to do what she did.  You don't just barrel through a high risk zone at full speed just because you have the right of way.  Not much point being right if you're dead.	Unprotected left turn. Driver 100% at fault.	None	I was sitting at a four way stop sign in a residential area once on my little Electron Blue Ninja. It was noon on a cloudless winter day, a beautiful day. A person in a pickup was on the cross street to my right, and she made a left turn to enter the street I was on. She drove right into me, hit me head-on. I went through my fairing and left a dent in her hood with my helmet, and wound up with my left leg pinned under the bike and my front wheel under her left front tire. The first words out of her mouth? "Where did you come from!?!?" I was stopped even with my front tire even with the stop sign per state regulations, to the left side of my lane per my training from the MSF course I'd taking just months before. I calculated that I had about 700ms to react once I saw her path turn enough to intersect me. She cut the corner, and obviously never saw me in my bright blue gear on my electron blue motorcycle in broad daylight.  When I related this story to my fellow forum members on the motorcycling sites I hung out on back then, I also got the flood of comments about how I could have been more defensive, and how I must share the responsibility for what happened, somehow. It was insane. So many people crawled out of the woodwork to explain how they could have avoided this collision, how they could have jumped off the bike to avoid getting hit, etc. 700ms. 7/10 of a second. That's when I truly discovered that I'm surrounded by nutjobs.	0
fz9xu4z	I'm writing an essay about putting forth a case to use a Jungian lens when examining and critiquing literature and need help finding a scholarly article or study about why men are interested in things whereas women are interested in people. Must be a biological or psychological article.	Are you considering that women being interested in people vs men being interested in things as a fact?  My statement was referring to the observed phenomenon of women's interests being regarded as less significant than men's interests due to this asserted 'fact'.  Corollary: that regarding women's interests as being as significant as men's interests is sometimes described as disregarding facts.	Could you clarify this? Not sure if Im interpreting what you are saying correctly   Im using it as a point that the Postmodernist lens when critiquing literature doesnt include facts in their analysis.	I would be more indifferent to this assertion but for the established reality that *some* men use it as a tool to minimize the importance of women's perspective on life, the universe and everything.	No I’m asserting that women’s interest aren’t less than men but that they have a biological difference engrained in them and that’s it. That’s why I asked for a source with biological evidence. I’m saying that postmodernists think everything is a social construction whereas I’m putting forth that some differences are biological.	0
fzb2agc	Truth hurts	Does France do a census to gain demographic data like the US does every 10 year? I feel that getting an accurate population of Arabs in France with the mass immigration in the past decade may be a challenge.   But if you broke that statistic down into "French French" and "French Arabs" it would probably undermine the objective of this image.	How about also separating the other countries races? As a french id like to see the numbers between french arabs (most recognizable minority here) and french whites.

We dont do it over everyone because it would be too time consuming, but i guess the data is still pretty accurate.	0
fzbzd8l	Act of homosexuality and incest between animals is the proof that they're not creatures of God	But why would god construct entities that do things that he is ostensibly against? If the behaviors are wrong on some sort of inherent level then it shouldn't matter if animals do them, it would still not be ideal.      Are the described behaviors only wrong because they are things that god has told us not to do, and if so did he arbitrarily select things to tell us not to do, or are they things that god universally is against. I just don't see why god would construct animals that have no free will but still do things he doesn't like, while commanding humans to not do those things.	> According to Abrahamic religions, homosexuality and incest is forbidden as a big sin.  ...for humans.  Animals also kill, steal, eat limbs from living animals, etc. Since those laws were only given to people, not animals, it is completely irrelevant.	None	> If the behaviors are wrong on some sort of inherent level then it shouldn't matter if animals do them, it would still not be ideal.  You are assuming the behavior is "wrong on some sort of inherent level", even for animals. I see no reason to believe that.  > if so did he arbitrarily select things to tell us not to do, or are they things that god universally is against  This is a false dichotomy. God's commandments could be both non-arbitrary and not something he is universally against for all creatures.  There are two major assumptions here:  1. Things forbidden by God are things God dislikes humans to do. 2. Things God dislikes humans to do, God dislikes animals to do.  I don't think either of these are true. I don't think they are supported by Jewish scripture, either.	0

What makes life worse than the shittiest freemium game is that you were never even asked if you wanted to play.  Gameplay - 0/10: toxic community. Pay-to-win. Wonky controls and lag for a lot of players that give others an unfair advantage. Player is given no choice over character design, stats allocation, ability to pause, difficulty setting, etc. Quitting the game is difficult.  Story - 0/10: lots of grinding with little payout. Stories aren't unique or exciting and have been beaten like a dead horse. Free-roaming is not allowed by gameplay mechanics due to players starving quickly.  Graphics and physics engine - 5/10: good, for the most part. Object physics is also generally consistent. Developers clearly went the lazy route when they implemented LawsofThermodynamics.exe. Most divine universe operating systems should be able to accommodate infinite resources and not to require an increase in entropy with an occurrence of every event.   Other: poor support. No updates. Developers have gone dead silent sinse the game's launch.  I think that's the one you were looking for.

Those problems were fine in an EA game but once they hit release, it was pretty inexcusable. Infinitely worse that they just left it like that for years while promoting the Early Access for their new game, which should have just been a DLC for Subnautica in the first place but they found a way to squeeze more money out of people for another broken, unfinished game instead of finishing the actual game they made.

g1w1xq5	I see this excuse used all the time and idk why	I think sakurai thinks being heavier and big is a better advantage than being fast and small	A character cant have everything about them be amazing. *pikachu has entered the chat*	Realistically, balance-wise, the real reason Ridley isn't also heavy is the same problem Bowser and Mewtwo run into: that they're all big and strong and durable and fast and heavy and have powerful ranged moves (and can fly in Mewtwo and Ridley's case). They're antagonists who are meant to be tough boss fights and as a result are absurdly well-rounded foes, with no actual weaknesses fighting-wise that aren't a result of tactical errors (Bowser leaving ways to fight him in the arena) or just whittling them down (Ridley and Mewtwo's health gauges).  When translated to Smash, however, a character can't have everything about them be amazing, there needs to be a few downsides. For Mewtwo and Ridley, they're not heavy in Smash, and for Bowser, his fire isn't as powerful as in Mario games (previously his speed was his drawback as well).	Well, killing really early gives a character a leg up. Do you want to be the character that kills in a couple hits? or the character that never lets those couple of hits happen?	0
g26sovf	[Australia] Crash when car pulls out in front of cammer	lol, those brakes were absolute garbage.    In the YouTube comments he said people often pull partially into the intersection to get a better view so he was used to them coming out part way and that contributed too his slower reaction speeds as he thought she was pushing out out to see better and not coming out all the way.  He also used the excuse that he had cruise control on but anyone who knows anything about cruise control knows it is disabled when you press the brake so that's not a valid excuse.	Was the cammer's car fitted with brakes? It's hard to tell.	None	Second excuse makes sense to me. Cruise control doesn’t disengage *until* you press the brakes. If he didn’t have cruise control on he would have been coasting, uphill, after taking his foot off the gas while the other driver was creeping into the intersection. Meaning his terrible brakes would have slowed him down a bit more, and he wouldn’t have hit the the other car quite as hard. It’s one of the main reasons using cruise control on roads like this isn’t always the smartest idea.	0

It takes ideological obsession of the worst kind to call Chile's economic history since Pinochet took power, a "Miracle". Chile's economy simply followed a trend in tandem with the state of world Copper prices. When Copper prices were shit, the economy went down the toilet. When they got better, the economy improved. But there was no genuine, long-term structural improvement in the economy during this time period until a Sovereign Wealth Fund was created to offset the otherwise vicious cyclicality of Copper's impact on the economy. The Sovereign Wealth Fund was created through policy by Michelle Bachelet, Prime Minister of Chile from 2006-2010, and from Chile's Socialist Party.	None	0

g5ylmcj	Need identify 2 lost parts. Dell inspiron 15 5577	Hi, in this case you might be able to grab a multimeter and figure out what kind of component they are. Multimeters are very cheap.	I live in not rich country here more good repair specialist. I see on motherboard 4 types of smd components already with identification. But they very similar. Thanks	Hi, those are SMD components. You need a parts list or a donor board.  EDIT: The good news is they will be cheap, the bad news is you need someone who can do smd soldering, which, for no good reason, is a dark art. Check out Lewis Rossman on youtube to see tutorials, but it will require expensive kit, unless you can borrow some.	None	0
g6dvor2	Wow	There are countless clear videos of this happening, both to peaceful protesters and to reporters. That doesn't mean *most* arrests and attacks from police have been unjustified (if that's what that guy meant then I disagree with him), but far too many of them have been. Unlawful police brutality is spiking just as badly as protestor violence right now, and this administration has been very vocal about painting BLM as some kind of evil terrorist anarchy organization that needs to be violently suppressed.	So this is the narrative people are riding with? It seems like the majority of people getting arrested are looters and thugs, and even then they're having trouble getting the charges to stick. That's why they end up back in the street, doing the same dumb shit they were doing before...	Its also okay for the police to arrest peaceful protestors with no weapons while white nationalists walk around with rifles.    Currently happening in Louisville and basically any other US protest.

g6dz165	Wow	&gt;if the cops and the witness neighbor are correct that they DID announce themselves? that's no sympathy for the boyfriend.

This might be a effort to avoid the echo chamber.  I didn't watch the debate because Trump upsets me so much I can't stomach it.  But as a result I didn't hear his points, perhaps if I found a way to make it so I could actually get the information without the pain.  Perhaps I should just read the transcript.

It was an explosives company so it was located in the middle of no where, South Carolina for safety reasons. This had to be 1991.  My point is this motherfucker has been poisoning the well for a *very* long time with a *very* consistent record.	republicans just need to *leave* the republican party, and stop voting for republicans and giving them money  You don't even have to vote for democrats -- yes, plenty of them are lousy, including joe biden  they also need to turn off fox news & rush limbaugh	If more Republicans don’t join Democrats to take a stand against this, it will happen again and again. If this isn’t something we all agree on, were doomed.	i'm 34, I remember riding along with my dad while he drove a tractor and would listen to sports radio and limbaugh (and the rest of the cohort, hannity, etc) all day long.  If you listen to sports radio today, right wing radio has really blended into those hosts as well, and you basically can't ever escape the indoctrination machine. Even the sportscasters are all basically trump supporters, even if they don't regularly advertise that fact  look at the shit lou holtz was saying on espn about just having to go ahead with the football season and sacrificing however many people we had to, to covid  oh, and I forgot right wing "christian" broadcasters that have pitched basically the same message  I also remember growing up and my dad would listen to John Hagee and his ilk-- megachurch pastor in san antonio, iirc, who endorsed trump -- and that dudes sermons *terrified* me as a teenager, constantly talking about the end of times, demons, the torture of hell, and so on	0

A 25-pack of wooden coins will cost you only $5 dollars.	In the 70s and 80s McDonalds used to do similar promotions where you handed out little gift certificates for free vanilla cones.	So it's a ploy to get people to do the dirty work of advertising to kids. Kids are going to need to have their parents take them to Lion's Choice.

g9k1jgr	COVID-19 said to be quickly spreading in Rural OK	The mandate was struck down a while ago so not sure where you're going with that, and in 2016 the CBO estimated that 90% of the uninsured in 2016 will be exempt from the mandate. On top of that, they had a system where tax credits would be given to employers to pay for insurance for their employees and that was at the Federal level and automatic.  It was left up to the states expand eligibility for medicaid and Oklahoma citizens voted in assholes who made it their life's mission to deny healthcare expansion until *this fucking year on June 30th and it passed by .98%!*  ***It took over 10 years of fighting to do what Oklahoma leaders should have done on day one and this ties back into what I said about the GOP not giving a shit about you.***  **Just to set the record straight:**  * I don't want free healthcare; I want my taxes to pay for it, not for war. * I don't want money from nothing; I want a job that pays for my basic needs. * I don't want a free place to live; I want affordable housing that cost no more than 30% of my income. * I  don't want corporations to be unprofitable; I want them out of the  political election, regulatory, and policy making processes. * I don't expect elections to deliver the result I want; I want my vote to count. * I don't want the wealthy to pay for everything; I want them to pay for their fair share.  This is to start off with.	Wat? I think you have a poor preception of what is really happening, most of the rural people were forced into purchasing expensive ass healthcare because of obamacare. Most of them own their own businesses like farmers and ranchers, so they were automatically excluded from receiving "the gibs" and government handouts.  Why would these people support that? All that did was hurt them.	Imagine that and then consider the fact that all these people have been voting against their interests for decades, closing down all the rural clinics and hospitals, loving ACA but ironically being against it at the same time because of it's shorthand name, Obamacare.  Why do I get dirty looks when I say things like, *they made their own beds, now they're gonna have to lie in them?*  Isn't that the reality?  We scream until we're blue in the face that the GOP does not give a shit about you, that they want you poorly educated and pacified so they can systemically destroy this state for profit, none of which they share with the people who generated that profit with their labour or voted in the assholes to remove the regulations so they could profit or profit even more.  The only valid reason for the State to exist is to take care of it's own people, but this state has given it's soul over to the corporations. We are a corporate state.	Right the mandate was struck down by who exactly? The GOP...I can agree our taxes should go to benefit the American people, but they do not. Joe Biden is a millionaire, nancy pelosi is a millionaire, chuck schumer and the list goes on. But they give Trump shit for having money as well. To be fair I don't vote republican, but I don't vote democrat either.   Free Healthcare does not tax the people not wanting to work. There are millions of people just getting a check cut every month and free food and healthcare. Why would they go to work? Everything they need is paid for. And all that does is cost working people more and more and more.	0

Fudds get some weird crap passed regarding hunting regulations. For a long time my home county had an outright ban on rifle hunting, and the only exploits around it were black powder guns or shotguns with rifled slug barrels. Virginia also had (maybe still has?) a ban on hunting on Sunday, which is strangely specific and religious in tone despite not coming from any Christian doctrine whatsoever.	Wtf.

gddc2t7	Been seeing these spoons all over Instagram. Decided to make a similar thing, but there are obvious differences. Anyway, it’s mildly interesting. Curious if anyone else has tried this.	It’s more for my dad who is having some trouble with his vision.  I think it can be helped by focusing on hitting the ball in the center and consciously watching the ball hit the strings.  Didn’t wanna spend 90 USD on the spoon with a racquet handle.	Had a buddy do exactly this back in the day.  Seemed to work out for him but wasn't something he spent too long with at a time.	None	Ahh okay.  A disclaimer though is that the sweet spot is not exactly the center of the elliptical shape...there are slight offsets depending on the speed of the incoming ball, racquet weight and balance, etc.  Down the road I would simply paint a target onto the string bed to use as well.  You can get overall feedback at the end of a session by seeing if the ball has any markings on it but also you can get a less punishing method of getting the hand-eye coordination in place.	0
gdgq1ck	Today is the feast of the Vietnamese Martyrs (1745-1862): An estimated 130,000 to 300,000 were killed for their faith. The martyrdom consisted of the missionary era and an era whose killings were politically motivated. The torture underwent is considered among the worst in Christian Martyrdom.	Are you aware that multiple French Catholics were stabbed to death / beheaded not even a month ago?   Surely we can appreciate the courage of these martyrs without minimizing the (albeit less common) violent persecution that happens on our side of the planet.	This is why I somewhat roll my eyes when people talk of persecution in the west. These martyrs suffered active persecution for generations, and despite all they endured maintained the faith. I could never imagine having their fortitude and conviction.	None	I think they were talking more about the American (especially evangelical) “persecution complex” where every minor slight against Christianity is compared to Rome feeding Christians to the lions.	0

Sounds like you got ahold of spice aka synthetic cannabis. I remember smoking it and it gave me the same type of effects. It doesnt slowly kick it it hits all at once and no matter how much you do itll always be to much	None	This,  Synthetic cannabinoids can most definetely be consumed safely, you just need to know which substance you want to try, research the shit out of it(theoretically, not talking about trying just yet) and when youre well informed order(powder not herb blends)from a trustworthy vendor and try amounts according to potency(for this you should try volumetric dosing(you ansolutely need a scale for this!(either oral or as a vape juice(DO NOT MAKE A HERBBLEND!!!HOTSPOTS!!)))

You know that there is a solution to the problem you describe: the North Korean model. The GDR-model is probably too liberal for your taste.	After the harm inflicted by the untrammelled movement of capital, it has become clear that also the free movement of people is a luxury which constitutes too great a cost, both on an economic and health perspective.	If your scale of gradation starts below the GDR, it won't be very broad. You know that East Germans craved for nothing like for free travel.	0
ggupisi	Jesus did not satisfactorily answer the pharisees' accusation that he was a sorcerer	Why would Satan want us to trust in Jesus for salvation?	You say this like it's inconceivable, but it's not. Why not do all that?

I mean, in several places in the Bible it warns against exactly this - the devil tricking people with scripture and wonders, and being a pretender.	Your argument is that Jesus could have pretended to be God’s Son, casting out demons, healing the lame/sick/blind, telling people to believe the Scriptures, all to... somehow trick people into worshipping Satan by trusting in Jesus for their salvation?	The hypothesis here is that Jesus is either Satan masquerading as a man or is working for Satan. Satan wants us to trust in Jesus because that means trusting in Satan over God.	0

Just how many people are there that are apparently so OK with children being raped all the time. And it really doesn't feel like that much is done about it. It's always stories from decades ago finally coming out (not the victims fault, you'd think at the time some people who knew about it would step forward and say "this is messed up"). Or it is some rich person just getting away with a slap on the wrist. Or the police doesn't even investigate for some reason.

Doesn't take much to set up an automod to prevent people posting images...	All of those art rips are from Mangaka this time, to celebrate the new year. It's Official artwork, so not fanart.  We always have waves like that everytime there is such an important date. (Like we will have another flood for Valentine's Day)  Also, even if you wanted that applied to the subreddit, it would requires a lot of moderators to keep watch of everything.

ghqn9md	Why is 666 the devil’s number?	&gt;An important thing to remember about Revelation is that it's a mix of poetry, warnings, and political commentary of the time.  I get that, though it was less political commentary as it was legit prophecy.  The lack of mentioning the destruction of Jerusalem (a prophecy of Jesus that took place in 70 AD) is a glaring omission and a good clue that the text was likely *not* written so late - the same could be said as to why the prophecy and fulfillment were not included in the Gospel of John. While John's Gospel was addressing a particular quality of Jesus and His ministry, this was one of the biggest prophecies that Jesus made and John, according to formal history, not being in Patmos at the time, would likely have been aware of what happened and would've ensured the recording of the fulfillment of this terrible prophecy as was customary of the Gospel writers. In addition to this, if Jerusalem was destroyed by the time of the composition of both the Gospel and Revelation, then one finds things like John referring to the pool of Bethesda in the present tense interesting considering the city was destroyed.   Going further, when we look at sections of scripture like Revelation 17 with the great prostitute on the beast, we see imagery that should take one back to scripture like Ezekiel 16, where Jerusalem is considered worse than a prostitute because, where prostitutes receive favors from those with whom they commit adultery, Jerusalem gave her favors to those who would commit adultery with her. Additionally, we read that this woman on a seven-headed beast (the heads referring to the seven hills on which the woman sits - Rome, at the center of the empire was built on seven hills - and seven kings) was *drunk with the blood of God’s holy people, the blood of those who bore testimony to Jesus*. Considering the earliest persecutors of the early church were Jewish zealots and verse 16, which reads, "they [the beast] will bring her to ruin and leave her naked; they will eat her flesh and burn her with fire," we begin to have a better perspective that this was reiterating the destruction of that great city, Jerusalem by the armies of Rome. While many of us start the dating with the words of Irenaeus, there are too many issues to make the late dating a "matter of fact."	I'm pretty sure that the Book of Revelation was written while John was on Patmos, meaning probably around 95 AD, meaning that Domitian was emperor and Nero had been dead for 27 years. An important thing to remember about Revelation is that it's a mix of poetry, warnings, and political commentary of the time.	Revelation 13:18 -   >*This calls for wisdom. Let the person who has insight calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man. That number is 666.*  The number was an encoded name of the individual John saw during the revelation he was given through an alpha-numeric coding system called "gematria." Considering clues that tell us the dating was more likely to have been completed before the destruction of Jerusalem during the rule of Vespasian in 70 AD and, likely, before the Year of Four Emperors, leaving Nero alive during the book's composition.   Superstition has resulted in the number to be synonymous with all things evil, leaving people panicking when their total at a store reaching $6.66 will cause them to buy a pack of Wrigley's to change it. There is no power in the number itself.	Jesus himself didn't write anything down, so the things written that he did say he might not have actually said. I would argue that the beast was a reference to the Roman Emperor Domitian, who banished him. Supposedly in Daniel's vision hundreds of years before, one of the beasts was supposed to refer to the future Roman Empire. I think there's a similarity between the physical description of said beast in Daniel and Revelation. In the beginning of Revelation, John says he is on the isle of Patmos. Unless he just took a voyage there, he was banished by Emperor Domitian for refusing to acknowledge him as a god. Either that, or John didn't actually write the Book of Revelation.	0

gi2if6y	Only 516 vaccines administered in France in the first week of the EU rollout despite having a stock of more than 500,000.

Probably not directly related to the initial approach to target care homes, but there was an IPSOS MORI survey done in December and France came out with only 40% of respondents saying they planned on taking the vaccine:  [https://www.ipsos.com/en/global-attitudes-covid-19-vaccine-december-2020](https://www.ipsos.com/en/global-attitudes-covid-19-vaccine-december-2020)  No idea why but it seems scepticism of vaccines is a big issue there.

Even if Germany is named as the country that has its shit together, I think we took over 1.5m doses end of year and a similar amount is coming on Jan 8^th - yet only 250k doses have been used.

Child labour has existed since the dawn of humanity.  Children always worked on their families farm to help out before the industrial revolution, in fact families would have more children just so they could help out laboring. It could only be gotten rid of in countries that got rich enough so that children didn't *need* to work to help support their families, [which usually happens when a country reaches 11k in income per capita](https://www.cato.org/publications/economic-development-bulletin/case-against-child-labor-prohibitions).   Don't believe me? [Here's](https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/22/opinion/reckonings-hearts-and-heads.html) Paul Krugman on the subject. Bangladesh tried banning child labour, turns out children didn't jut go back to school and lived happily ever after, instead they either starved to death or became prostitutes.   The ancap solution is to let the free market enrich society enough so that children no longer need to work, as it did in the developed nations.	None	None	0
gi573io	Trinitarians are wrong	When your argument fails to use proper categories, it’s really hard to get anywhere. Try this definition instead:  &gt; Within the one Being that is God, there exists eternally three coequal and coeternal persons, namely, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  A more precise way to express your three points, using proper categories, would be:  1. The One Divine Being that is God is triune, consisting of three persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit 2.  Jesus is Divine in nature, the Father is Divine in nature, and the Holy Spirit is Divine in nature 3.  Therefore Jesus is one of the three persons of the triune Divine Being (God).  /u/iceamorg	Exactly. I wonder which premise they deny? Rewording your argument slightly:  1. God is triune 2. Jesus is God 3. Therefore Jesus is triune  'Jesus is God' apologists must either affirm 3 (which is not orthodox), deny 1 or 2, or deny the laws of logic. They can't have it both ways without equivocation.	...Can all the Trinitarians out there downvoting but not responding please take this post to your preferred theological authority and kindly relay a plain refutation?	The point we are making is that Jesus is not God, the "triune Divine Being."  Furthermore, Jesus is not Jehovah, or Yahweh, the proper name for God in the Hebrew bible. This makes for some interesting theological problems for the trinitarian — just who is the trinitarian actually worshipping?	0

gj3slg6	Indisputable American gun violence evidence	"gun control may partially mitigate, but not prevent [suicides]" is more accurate, but not as elegant.	Theres a flaw in your statement, that making it harder to commit suicide by overdose reduced the number of overdose suicides. This isnt really meaningful without the total number of suicides to see if those people didn't turn to a different method.	I agree with your conclusion but I have to call to validity the statement "22,938 (76%) are by suicide **which can't be prevented** by gun laws (3)"  [In a study done in the UK](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC526120/) to try and reduce suicide via otc drug overdose, they changed a number of pharmaceuticals commonly used for suicide to be sold in blister packs rather than bottles, so that if you wanted to get a deadly handful of pills you have to open each pack individually. This resulted in a significant measurable lowered rate of overdose suicides because of the additional steps needed to do the deed.   My point is that making it harder to commit suicide **DOES** reduce the chances of someone actually following through with their suicide.   I'm not arguing for gun control, but the statement  "... they can't be prevented" is a false one.	None	0

A great suggestion but honestly I'd rather just get rid of the entire +7 bonus from the WC guild, as it has completely streamlined the woodcutting skill to one area of the game. It'd be nice to be able to train WC in some of the other beautiful places in Gielinor without feeling like you're missing out on what is a very significant bonus that the WC guild currently offers.

It boils down to this; if a claim is made, evidence must be provided to substantiate and support that claim. Then the evidence itself is analyzed. If a claim is made without evidence, there is nothing to address, nothing to analyze, it is just a baseless claim that ends there. He is saying without evidence to examine, the claim dissolves then and there. The evidence is what is examined to prove a claim correct or valid.  Edit: typo	None	I agree. Basically what you are saying is I need to justify why the person making a claim needs to provide evidence for it.

ddnrr1c	Jesse Owens of USA after winning gold in Summer Olympics, Nazi Germany[1936]	Yeah, Dixiecrats were the worst.  After the parties switched positions in the 60s, it became the republicans who were racist.  Neither party has the moral high ground as far as I'm concerned.	Because FDR was another racist Democrat who liked to put people in camps. 	Said he was treated better in Nazi Germany than he was at home.  Hitler treated him with respect, but FDR completely snubbed him.  https://www.google.com/amp/www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/olympic-hero-jesse-owens-snubbed-8051702.amp	The Democratic Party started in the 1820s. Right away, it switched sides, as we can see from the fact that they pushed for the removal and extermination of Indians. Also, their opposition was the Whig party, which was against the Indian Removal Act and vowed to protect minorities against mob rule. Because the sides were switched, the vast majority of Whig party were anti-slavery. (Eventually, there was rift in the party over the issue of slavery, and anti-slavery members of the Whig party, including Abraham Lincoln, exited the party and formed the Republican Party. As we can see, the parties must have switched again because it's common knowledge that republicans are actually the racist ones.)   Then the parties switched when the democrats are on record as having mainly been the ones who owned slaves. Not all democrats owned slaves, but 100% of slaves were owned by democrats. Not a single republican in history owned a slave. As we know, the parties switched again when republicans repudiated slavery and democrats defended it, leading to the civil war.   Then the parties switched again when a democrat assassinated republican Lincoln. After the civil war, the parties switched again during the reconstruction era, when republicans attempted to pass a series of civil rights amendments in the late 1800s that would grant citizenship for freedmen. As evidence of the switch, the democrats voted against giving former slaves citizenship, but the civil rights amendments passed anyway.   The parties switched again when the Democratic Party members founded the KKK as their military arm. Democrats then attempted to pass the first gun control law in order to keep blacks from having guns and retaliating against their former owners. A county wanted to make it illegal to possess firearms, unless you were on a horse. (Hmmm wonder who rode around on horses terrorizing people 🤔). Gun control has always been a noble cause touted by democrats, but the racist reasons why the concept of gun control was dreamed up was a part of a party mentality switch, but not the actual party.   Somewhere around this time former slaves fought for gun rights for all, and the NRA was formed. The NRA switched parties too when they defended the right for blacks to arm themselves and white NRA members protected blacks from racist attackers.   The parties switched again when republicans fought to desegregate schools and allow black children to attend school with white children, which democrats fought fiercely against.   The nation saw a rash of black lynchings and bombings of black churches by the democrats in the KKK and the parties switched again when Democrat Bull Conner tried to avoid prosecuting the racist bombers to get them off the hook. When blacks protested this injustice, the party-switched democrat Bull Conner sicced dogs and turned the hose on them. He also gave police stand down orders when the KKK forewarned attacks on the freedom riders, who had switched parties.   The parties switched again when a Democratic Party president appointmented the first and only KKK member to the Supreme Court.   The parties switched yet again when Democratic president FDR put Asians in racist internment camps.   Then parties switched again when the democrats filibustered the passing of the second set of civil rights laws giving equal protection to minorities.   The parties switched when a democrat assassinated MLK.   This brings us to modern times. The parties continue to switch all the time. The parties switched when democrats proposed racist policies like affirmative action to limit opportunities for certain racial groups in order to grant privilege to other racial groups.   The parties switched when the Islamic fundamentalist Omar Mateen and several other ISIS mass shooters aligned themselves with democratic candidates like Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton.   The parties switched again when liberal student groups in schools like UCLA and Berkeley call for segregated housing to make "separate but equal" housing quarters for black students. Actually this is a current ongoing thing, so the parties are right now in the middle of switching on this topic.   Parties always switched currently now that democrats are rioting and violently protesting democracy.   So as you can see, because of Party switching, democrats were always the ones who stood up against racism and wanted peace and unity while republicans were always the racist and violent ones calling for division and discord.	0

dgvy5rf	I've a potentially unpopular opinion about Rand, Mat and Perrin in light of the recent TV series casting posts.	&gt; -Rand and Egwene aren't really kids to start out.   Perrin &amp; Mat are born within the same month or so as Rand. Nynaeve is a few years older. Everyone should be late teens/early 20's at the outset.   Which probably means whoever they cast will be 30, going by how Hollywood does these things. 	That's probably how the majority of people look at each new screen adaption of a popular coming-of-age saga, going back to the example of Star Wars.  While in theory, real unknowns is ideal, I think that the best available, willing actor with ensemble chemistry is the right choice. Logistically, they will probably be relative newcomers.  The Shannara Chronicles is frequently held out as an example of how things can go wrong, but from a casting standpoint it gives me hope that the Two Rivers gang might make it onto screen with talent and chemistry. But hopefully they'll *all* resemble their book selves.  Final thought, as others have said--Rand and Egwene aren't really kids to start out. They're on the cusp of adulthood, but the actors will probably be 20-somethings, as it's more experience by which they grow up, not physically going from children to full-grown adults.	None	None	0

The size of the windowish area looks like this may've been a hole for an air conditioner unit. They may've gone all of the way to the floor with the fix for some reason, e.g. support.  My house has one of these patch jobs, and on the outside there is a square of bricks that don't interlock with the surrounding bricks.  Right next to it was a very large nice glass block window. They plastered over it, on the inside. So you could see it from the outside, but not inside.

dzh0l3l	Should the Tezos foundation use buybacks as a price stabilization strategy?	&gt; No I would not think you would protect on the upside, only the downside.  If price stabilization is the only end you're aiming to achieve, then clearly you've got to protect in both directions. Volatility is volatility, up or down.  If you're *not* going to protect against the upside, well then, clearly you have motivations other than just stabilizing the price.	No I would not think you would protect on the upside, only the downside.  Defending a market manipulation may involve a strategy which my include both directions but I cannot conceive of one where you would want to limit the upward trend.	Should we use sell-offs as a price stabilization strategy?  We've got a massive windfall; the last thing we ought to do is piss it away in an attempt to mitigate price discovery.	There are natural protections for the upside.  Keep in mind the purpose of stabilization is not to somehow keep morally pure by keeping it equal to the dollar (for instance).  It is to help people to maintain a higher level of confidence than not doing it or as compared to other currencies not doing it.  If you think Tezos climbing in value would damage confidence then by all means - be an advocate for selling.  Perhaps that will be the case someday.    I will not go into detail on the specifics on how to do this but it is possible.  There are ways to leverage your liquidity not only to stabilize but to come out even over time so that you neither lose or gain foundation dollars.	0
e1jzzsn	Pro-Palestinian extremists belie their won hypocrisy by accepting Zionist rationale	No matter how you want to word it: ***genocide is wrong.***	I said it before, but worth repeating: this kind of historical apologetics is typical of online discussion about Israel / Palestine, and it is circular and pointless.

Nothing seemingly changed in my life recently except a positive change but that was a while ago, like 3 months ago I switched to a new school.

eln4kgv	Adultery is grounds for a divorce.	Trophy wives aren’t people in their husbands eyes.  If she wanted to fuck him part of the reason was the satisfaction of knowing she had disrespected her “husband”	Not trying to fuck someone elses wife is far from cowardly.	Showed up at a rich beach house to do manual labor busting up tile.   The husband shows me the job and then says hes leaving and wont be back for several hours.   The 10/10 spanish trophy wife with a thick accent says it's nice to meet me and that she will remain on site.   The room where the job is located has this huge bay window. This smokeshow of a woman comes back in a bikini and climbs into a hammock outside, framed by the window, and starts applying oil to herself while watching me work. In hind sight there is zero chance she didn't do this on purpose.  I couldn't stop thinking that I've seen porns that start that way. I did absolutely nothing and can't think of a real reason to explain why other than cowardice. Shame to my famiry.  Noticed some rare ammo in the front seat of the husband's jeep when he returned and I was leaving, so it's probably for the best.	How do you know she's a trophy wife and not just, like, a wife?	0

This kind of feels like they are using the modern day obsession with people's sexuality to flog sandwiches. Is that not a bad thing to do? Can we sell cakes to people not sure of their gender by saying it contains Trans-fats? Sell chicken to black people by using patois in their adverts? Wait KFC actually already do that.  Sorry to make a funny sandwich joke all serious, but do we not have a problem with giant corporations highjacking serious modern day issues to sell us shit? Is that not seriously condescending?   It's as bad as Selfridges in the Trafford centre selling vodka with a bee on the bottle a few months after the Manchester terror attack.

This is a good opportunity to research what you want the next leg of the adventure to be. If you want to homebrew something then you already have some good options.

They drank from those collapsible shot glasses that are nearly the size of a rocks glass, toasting each other every time by saying "Goodbye, my friend".

exqsoaj	Substance use?	It is possible that it has negative side effects.  That being said, any current testing of the substance must be called into question given that its legal status prevents it from being fully investigated, tested, and peer reviewed.  Until its legal federally, any so called testing that has been done must be heavily questioned and doubted.   That being said, if we are considering anecdotal evidence, we cannot ignore the positive effects it has.  There are pain patients and seizure sufferers who would be far worse off than if they could not get the substance.  True the stories are subjective, but so are any "studies" that have been done.	Drug use is an objectively dumb decision while they're illegal and still arguably dumb even without the legal consequences.  It's also degrading and unhealthy - people like to pretend weed is "very casual" and "perfectly healthy" but [studies have proven](https://www.pnas.org/content/109/40/E2657) that weed does, in fact, damage your brain.  I say, find something better to do with your time.	None	>There are pain patients and seizure sufferers who would be far worse off than if they could not get the substance.  You're getting into the realm of medical use which is pretty clearly not related to the OP or my post.

How about not breeding when you can't feed or support offspring?  Maybe if they didn't breed like roaches they might have a better life for all NOT JUST for their families.  Note how no one gives a flying fuck about OTHER people and THEIR families.  Breeders are just greedy assholes using their kids as an excuse to steal from others.  End breeder entitlement completely.  Using children to get welfare, to be allowed to invade another nature is EXACTLY the problem and why overpopulation is what will destroy us all.

f1jgiv9	Juan Mata: What Louis van Gaal was like at first Manchester United meeting	&gt; LVG's methods from the 90s were just not up to speed for the pace of English football in this decade.

Or was it when he consistently beat United's top 6 rivals? Or when he won the FA cup? Was that all because his style was "not up to speed"?  And with respect to international football, his success with the Dutch team in 2014, with both Blind and Van Persie in the team?   You can claim he failed, but you cannot claim he wasn't  "up to speed". There were other factors at play, and those are apparent now, aren't they?	Right man, wrong era.  LVG's methods from the 90s were just not up to speed for the pace of English football in this decade.	Interesting, seems more sentimental than I imagined. Shame it didn't work out. Had a good personality and our football was good... up until the scoring bit.	This kind of comment completely obfuscates all context, and I don't know where even to begin.  >You mean except when he beat Ferguson 2-1 in March 2010 in the CL, then progressed to the next round after eliminating Ferguson's top, top side on aggregate   Firstly, Bayern shouldn't even have been playing us in the first place.

Secondly, you have ignored how we were trashing Bayern 3-0 in the second leg at Old Trafford until Rafael's controversial sending off changed the game and saw Bayern lose 3-2 but go through on away goals.  Much like Mourinho did in 2013, even LVG was classy enough to later admit we were the better side in 2010.

Why did he refuse to invest in defensive players [in the summer]? Why the constant positional changes? Why is he not interested in practising defensive dead-ball situations?"  There are plenty more where this came from.  >Or was it when he consistently beat United's top 6 rivals? Or when he won the FA cup? Was that all because his style was "not up to speed"?  You have ignored his record outside the top 6, and how we managed just 70 and 66 points in his 2 seasons.  >And with respect to international football,   International football is a very different cup of tea. You might want to remember how Scolari, a World cup winner with Brazil and Euro finalist with Portugal, failed badly at Chelsea.  >You can claim he failed, but you cannot claim he wasn't "up to speed".

Its really the white guys fault, he should have let go as soon as he was lifted off the ground. In jiu jitsu they teach you to NEVER let your opponent lift you off the ground. MMA is a dangerous sport, Id be more worried about a vicious head kick than a slam.	Holding your opponent off the ground like this seems too dangerous to be allowed.

fltvbi9	First attempt at fresh spring rolls. Filled with pan fried tamari tofu, vermicelli, carrots, cabbage and cilantro. With a lot of lime juice drizzled on top	Absolutely.

fs9cm3m	Clear some things up...[part 2]	Hint: The WM3 knowingly gave up the right to challenge the evidence  when they STIPULATED TO THE SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE in exchange for a reduced sentence.  This is not about supporting, or not supporting testing, as your straw man alludes, and it the prime example of the rationalizations you all make when presented with facts. You just make up shit.  It's a faux issue, a false premise. They made an agreement that ended any claim they had against that evidence.  The WM3 traded those claims away themselves.  I'm all for them voiding the plea agreement, and reinstating the original conviction so they can challenge the evidence, and get all the testing they want, because I know it will lead nowhere other than Echols getting executed and the others likely spending the rest of their lives in prison for murdering three boys.  Finally, they've had almost 30 years to present NEW evidence, and have not provided any new evidence. Not one single piece of evidence. Their only claim is to attack the existing evidence, and they traded that legal claim away.  The three of them have not made any legal effort to get their conviction overturned, since their release, other than asking for a pardon.  They are not even fighting to be exonerated, they are just claiming they are.  They can go file a motion in a court to try and get testing done, that has not occured (and there is a very good reason why).  They've done legally nothing to get the testing done, other than cry to the media.  You keep supporting them doing nothing, other than whining to reporters and media-types. It's actually some disgusting irony.	the "WM3 are guilty" folks don't support the retesting or new testing of evidence because it would very likely prove them wrong. that's pretty much it  they don't care about finding out who really killed those three boys	Honest question:  Can I ask what your background and credentials are that would prove your knowledge in this area is indeed factual and correct?   Also, if this is true...Wouldn’t someone, like a Jim Clemente, who was a prosecuting attorney come out and openly agree with what you just said and put a stop to this? Like for real, if this is true, wouldn’t one of the consulted experts have advised Bob Ruff or whomever that the existing evidence can never be tested again? If this is a publicity stunt, don’t you think it would have been shut down already if that due diligence was done?   Now, before you call me a tool again, I’m just asking honest questions.   Also, by your theory that the evidence used against them in the original convictions cannot be used to exonerate them, what about the evidence of that was collected and has NEVER had any extensive testing done on it? Shouldn’t evidence that was never included in the original case against them that is just sitting there be fair game?	how do you know they're guilty?   also, how do you know they're not fighting for exoneration? or fighting for new testing? just because we don't know about it, doesn't mean they're not doing it.	0

They keep pest species down and save me money on repairs. I keep them inside so they dont in turn get eaten by other predators.

fyw3chd	Taking question regarding Aristotelian-Thomistic metaphysics	Sorry it has taken me so long to reply, I was in the process of responding to the guy above and finishing an essay for school.  The fifth way is an argument from finality - I use the term finality in place of *teleology* so as to not confuse the argument with anything akin to arguments from intelligent design, or *Paleys Teleological argument* or *the watchmaker argument*.  Now, the argument can be divided into three parts, which essentially state that; (1) objects and their operations are describable in terms of causal powers; (2) and these causal powers are irreducible and exhibit some degree of regularity; (3) so there must be some intelligent agent which endowed these objects with their causal powers and normative functions.  We'll address each of these in turn.  Beginning with (1), we say that objects have causal powers - as opposed to being inert chunks of matter following external natural laws - for several reasons. First and foremost, and most obviously, it makes little sense to refer to natural laws without making reference to an object which follows the laws. To understand this point better, try and explain a natural law to me without referencing any particular subject or variable in place of this subject, which adheres to this law. You simply can't. Whenever a physicist talks about laws of gravity, or inertia, or whatever, he is always making a statement about some highly abstracted and mathematical object which is the subject of the operations of these natural laws. So, granted this, we can make an induction stating that since it is impossible to reference laws without making reference to an object which follows them, then it is more likely and cogent that these laws aren't external to the objects - but, rather they are internal to them as causal powers.  Furthermore, consider the simple fact that objects - on account of what they are - behave in different ways. Water can hydrate me in a way in which gasoline cannot. A tennis ball has a lesser gravitational pull than the moon. A rubber bouncy ball has a greater elasticity than a bowling ball does. These examples can be repeated ad infinitum. For these reasons (among others) we say that objects have causal powers.  Secondly (2), we see that these causal powers and operations which substances engage in are highly normative. There is a degree of regularity exhibited by the substances on account of what they are. If I drop a tennis ball off of my room 10 million times, I would expect for it to reach the ground the vast majority of the time. This isn't to say that we are committed to a strict form of determinism, as probability amplitudes are enough to establish *some* degree of regularity. And amplitudes are sufficient to demonstrate this proof.  Now, the other part of part (2) concerns the irreducibility of these causal powers. What this means is that the product of a causal interaction (ie. a substance) has its causal powers in a way which its parts or efficient cause do not. Consider a water molecule, H2O. This molecule is composed of two hydrogen atoms, and a single oxygen atom. Now, these hydrogen atoms have certain characteristics proper to only hydrogen atoms - such as the capacity to burn at 932 degree Fahrenheit - and the oxygen atoms have properties proper to it - like the property of having a melting point at -219 degrees Celsius. Now, both of these atoms on their own are combustible, and both have different distinct properties - but when combined into a water molecule they lose this capacity to be combustible, and further gain the property of being able to hydrate me. So this property of hydration is something neither of the constituent parts of the water molecule retained. So we cannot account for the waters causal powers by a mere appeal to their constituent parts alone. We must appeal to the efficient cause of their union.  This brings us to point (3), concerning the fact that an intelligent agent must be the cause of the causal powers of substances. Imagine, for example, a piece of string and a stick. Combined together they form an artifact, namely a fishing pole. Where in the causal powers of the stick or the string is the final cause of *catching fish*? Obviously, it is in neither of the constituent parts of the fishing pole. As a matter of fact, the only object we've mentioned which has this final cause is the fishing pole itself. But this final cause is required prior to the formation of the fishing pole - because the efficient cause of the fishing pole requires some idea of its effect to produce its effect. And any appeal to the fishing pole as it exists to account for this final cause would be circular, as we would be saying the fishing pole is ontologically and causally prior to its own instantiation, and that it can account for its own properties.  So, to solve this issue, we say that this conception of the final cause of the fishing pole exists in the mind of the artificer - the person who made the fishing pole. Since this idea of the final cause cannot exist in the objects which constitute the artifact, it must come from an external intelligence.   Now this example is imperfect as artifacts are different from substances - but the same principle applies. Since the final cause of the effect is required prior to the effects instantiation, and since this final cause cannot be found in the material parts constituting the effect, then it must be located in some external intellect which unifies these two parts.  This might have been a little choppy, so if you have any questions or anywhere is unclear please don't hesitate to ask.	Can you explain/expound on the fifth proof?	None	None	0
fzd1uls	He-Man, Masters of the Universe. I watched this every day after school. Enjoy!	I may as well have been one of your buddies. We had a group of 5 that did this. My brother was 3 years younger, and I recall him starting a similar after school group that watched Gummi Bears, then Ducktales, and the rest of the Disney afternoon stuff.   On Friday Nights we would watch Dukes, later Miami Vice, then play board games or d&amp;d or Battletech. We’d try and go camping at least once a month!  Miss those days!!!	When I was a kid there were five of us that hung out on the block, 3 of us were in the same grade and two younger siblings. We would run home from school everyday to one of our houses, watch he man, voltron (sometimes both versions), GI Joe and Thundercats (depending on the tv lineup).  Then afterwards we'd get thrown outside where we'd pretend we were either He Man characters or Voltron  and beat the hell out of each other with home made swords.  They stopped letting us watch the dukes of hazard when we decided to light our friend's general lee on fire and send it down the biggest hill in town, through traffic. I tell you what, that was a day the Duke boys almost didn't get out of that tight spot.

g04i5gs	Can Shards have children?	Athena didn't issue children from her head. She came from the head of Zeus	You know when Athena pops children from her forehead? If that counts as children, most creations of the shards are 'children' so I guess the answer is greek yes?	None	Ops! My mistake. You are indeed correct, but my point is made.   Funfact: while fact checking this, I found out that Erichtonius, son of Hephaestus, was the result of the latter trying to rape Athena, failing but jerking on her leg.

g21vju5	What Are My Options For Entry Level Positions That Require The Least Amount Of Customer Service (And Will Lead To Positions With Literally No Customer Service)	&gt; Go find a different career.  Any suggestions?	Go find a different career. That's the best advice anyone will give you regarding this question. You will very seldomly find a job within IT that doesn't require 'some' form of customer service abilities. IT at its CORE is customer service. Whether it's internal users or client facing impact, the industry is literally designed to keep those people and their processes functioning.   Before some whiny cowboy comes yelling at me in here: Yes it's technically 'possible' to find a job with no customer service needed. You'll also hit a VERY low ceiling salary wise, and your upward trajectory will be extremely limited.	None	Judging by the attitude of ignoring the content from a seasoned professional in this industry for the sake of being a cunt, you would probably fit in working in a sewer	0
g26ofom	Vaush doesn’t know what he’s talking about, but thinks he got it all figured out	You do know I’m black, right? You do know I campaigned for black women politicians, right? You do know I have interacted with my community about politics, right?  You’re projecting and how disrespectful is it you use black ppl randomly like a rhetorical tool.  Tell me where will you be for the black people currently incarcerated, homeless, in student loan debt and lack healthcare. How much does our lives matter outside of a debate? Eat a d**k	Blah blah blah we get that you dont like gay and black people, no need to justify yourself.	Marx discouraging you from neglecting politics because it prevents any chance at overthrowing institutions. However, many “Bernie or Busters” are actually considering 3rd party to get it to a 5% vote. This doesn’t sound like folks abstaining from politics. Also, abstaining from US electorialism isn’t necessarily abstaining from politics entirely. Marx saying the way the workers acheives political power isn’t the same everywhere and it varies on factors depending on country. Marx saying workers acheiving their goals through peaceful means is literally not based on current 2020 US America. It’s based on 1872 America in which everything was completely different. Vaush is operating in this need to prove his position is valid and that he is the leftist when he is misinterpreting and removing the nuance from Marx and Lenin.	Rhetorical tool? Do you actually think black people will be better off with trump? As for my whereabouts, I’ll be voting to try and make sure there lives don’t get worse, instead of larping and pretending I’m some type of leftist revolutionary.	0
g2pkn1j	First time posting here - ready to take critique!	Thank you so much for commenting! I was expecting to get a comment on dynamics; now that I listen to the take after some time has passed, it sounds even more monotonous than I thought. Unfortunately, that's not just my control that contributes to this; I'm playing a midi keyboard that sends very limited and inaccurate midi data - this is the best I've made it respond after hours of tweaking.  Anyway, I'm glad you liked it, it means a lot to me :)	Very well played. Enjoyed your rendition very much. :)  If I have to move a critique, it's mostly about the control of dynamics: the original piece is dreamy and ethereal (there's also a synth pad in the background to emphasize this "dreamy" sensation). To provide the same feeling with piano alone, you should probably control your accompaniment and make it softer, especially the chords.  In any case, it's a minor thing.  Aside from that, I think you did a great job, it was very pleasant to listen to. :)	None	None	0
g2sw2gy	Gonna be a long night	One of the best PSP games in my opinion... however....

g2t3tg1	A TON of Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War leaks have surfaced from MW game files, 2 days ahead of the trailer reveal	I was just assuming that Black Ops: Cold War was going to be a soft reboot of the Black Ops franchise just like how Modern Warfare 2019 is a soft reboot of the Modern Warfare franchise.  But the official game description says it's a direct sequel.  In order to make Woods a character they'll probably have to retcon some stuff.	It cant be a direct sequel. Woods was gone when its set, but is in the game apparently.   Maybe its retconning 2-3? Im thinking references will be made to Masons brainwashing and assassination of JFK but thats about it. Also I believe its supposed to tie into Modern Warfare.	Interesting.  So it's a direct sequel to the original Black Ops.  Good.  It could answer some questions like how Woods survived and escaped from the Hanoi Hilton and why Grigori Weaver did not appear in Black Ops 2.  The original game also had data files you could discover that talked about stuff that happened after Black Ops: like Mason, Weaver, and Hudson going rogue from the CIA during an op in South Africa which results in the CIA asking the Brits to send an SAS team after them (it's also hinted that a member of the Price family may be in charge of the mission).  The files also mention a woman who is actually a Soviet agent who is sent to seduce and inform on Mason.	Couldn't they fit it in the tight timeframe between the events of the Black Ops 2 flashbacks? But again, if they do that, how would characters like Raul Menendez fit in?	0

g30s35c	Parallel runways with different numbers?	Thank you for the explanation. That was more detail than I was expecting, but very much welcomed and appreciated.	Howdy neighbor!  I am also based at KDTO!  The reason the new runway is numbered as it is has to do with a snafu between TxDOT (who was providing funding and some project management) and the FAA.    The two parts werent communicating properly. So one side didnt get key items done with regard to approaches, and another didnt get the power set up done and the lighting project green lighted.    Talking to the airport manager, they were super keen on getting the ready to go pavement open for traffic, so the compromise was to set the new runway as 17/35.  And the first landings happened last year in November.    Fast forward to this summer and the runway lights and the PAPI are in and the new electrical vault is being installed next to the control tower.    Soon, the FAA department responsible for designing and approving approaches will be here and we should have a GPS approach for both ends of the new runway.     Once that is done, DTO will have 18L/36R and 18R/36L	None	Your welcome.  How often do you fly at KDTO and what equipment?	0
g3l66ls	Is Donald Trump lying when he said Joe Biden wants to ban Fracking? You decide...	Yes he should, but he won't. He's a liar. He only said that he'll get rid of it to appeal to the leftist part of his base. Now he got the nomination and doesn't give a shit anymore. He'll make his donors happy. Sanders was a weakling, but at least an honest weakling. The only other honest candidate was Tulsi. The rest were all liars who were bought before they even ran for office.

It would have featured the return of Michael Ironside as the voice of Sam, and the game was intended to be the "grand finale" of the Splinter Cell saga, with lots of callbacks to previous games and Easter eggs for people who have been fans since the first game.  But that's the last I heard of it.    I mean, it was nice having Sam Fisher show up in Ghost Recon: Wildlands for a misson.  But I want another actual Splinter Cell game.

g9p4sb1	Compile Elixir applications into single executable binaries, with Bakeware	All OSes provide some way to make binary look for dynamic libraries at given paths, so it shouldn't be a big problem there.	Neat! For macOS you could consider creating a .app bundle, it shouldnt be a whole lot more work than what youre doing and wouldnt require an out-of-bundle cache.   I suspect one thing you may run into is that Erlang dynamically links a few libraries (OpenSSL is a big one).  That usually ultimately limits portability of releases. It would be cool to have a way around that.	None	What I generally run into is, say your CI machine has OpenSSL 1.1 and you deploy to a machine with OpenSSL 1.0 (not these specific versions necessarily). The deployed release may not work, regardless of how you configure the dynamic library loader.   In production systems it’s usually not too hard to control for that but with user applications it’s much more difficult.	0

Gage already has 3 grow ops and a dozen-ish stores in Michigan.	Not a chance. If you have gambling money, sure, but youre betting it all on an outcome that you perceive to look obvious. I dont doubt that Biden will take it but it wont be as far a win as many predict, Id say  Watch last night?

gajer02	PSA - scratch near the end of Episode 5 is going to be 2 Week Long AC Support Scratch.	Just want to say that just because you can get it for meseta doesn't mean its not p2w. Infact the people paying for those to sell on market is definition p2w as you're giving them meseta which they use to increase their power. Now whether or not you think it matters at all in a casual pve game is a different story.	Guys AC Support Scratch might sound like it's Pay to Win for some, but remember, it's all randomized in a lootbox gacha AC, the people who rolled stuff they don't want will put it up on sale in the Personal Shop for Meseta so that's how you get them for free as a F2P or Dolphin.	None	But that's how it has been aren't it? Meseta can be earned by in game ARKs Mission/Daily Orders/Client Orders for **Free** though, even putting up items using excubes for FUN scratch is pretty easy. The fact that everyone just get the Atlas EX/Lightstream(or whatever the name is on Global) weapons and Ivlida units for **Free**, or from the Personal Shop for meseta? What about that? If Free Players who never paid any dime at all can achieve the 7-8s Affixes with maxed out weapons readied for endgame? If you just pay all the money you have into the game, sure you can get the weapons and all, but without effort and practicing, you will still die and fail anyways, just because the bots can sell you RMT meseta, it doesn't mean it's Pay To Win when it's eligible to be permanently banned and all that meseta will just vanish like that, what's the point of paying for those meseta then when the GMs can track your Tradings and purchases anyways. Of course and its a PVE game too and PVP ain't gonna allow you to bring in your endgame gear too so ehh true that.	0

There are thousands upon thousands of medical scientists, professionals, and doctors with alternative information, but the cult is quick to seal themselves off to any information not blessed by the cult leader Fauci.	He loses me pretty quickly when he starts talking about a Twitter battle he got in and calls people who believe in COVID some of the least scientific people. So, Anthony Fauci, who has dedicated his life to studying disease is less trustworthy than he!      I'll go ahead and stick with Fauci over the libertarian guy with a podcast.

gcmkixh	Commander Legends Collectors Booster Case Opening and takeaways.	Nothing is special anymore. Wizards has opened Pandora's box and *really* fucked over collectors, players, and finance folks.   There are too many variants to care about collecting, the supply of cards isn't limited so the game will be flooded with T1 decks that were previously constrained by the number of copies of a card that existed, and people who care about their collection's value wind up seeing nothing but losses.   The terrible thing is that this cannot be fixed. If Wizards decided to reign in this experiment and go back to just doing cards and foils, then when sales go down because the product is just *bad* (which it has been, by the way) big daddy Hasbro will look at the secondary market and say, "gee, those etched foils that we did that *one* time are really in demand! Toss some of those in there!"  Wizards needs to stop trying to dupe people with so many variants and just make a game that people want to play. Or you know, actually make chase rares *chase rares*.	3 etched foils per pack? i guess they aren't special	None	i totally agree. and yeah, the pandora's box is open, so we can't go back now	0

They need to get a lot of the etched foils out into the world to see how they are going to hold up.  I have a feeling that these may fully replace the traditional foiling in a year or two if they can resist the curling.

gd579q6	Net Promoter Score formula misuse	It gets sticky when we try to explain this hybrid calculation to our delivery drivers that are performing the service. It would be easier for them to understand a normal CSAT as we aren’t converting their scores down. It raises the question, why do we even offer that range of scores if it all means the same thing ( 0-6=-100). We lose delivery driver trust with the hybrid scoring system as they don’t care about the scores even though there are monetary incentives. You’re right, the company can do whatever it wants but those being performance managed by it should be able to understand stand it reasonably. That’s more of my concern, it’s being used to performance manage but no one really understands the metric.	It is not illogical. customers that score 9 or 10 are delighted to be using some service and will most probably evangelize that part of service. so that might not be a bad thing.  On the other hand you are right, most common is that the NPS formula gets associated with likelihood to recommend.  But NPS calculation needs numbers not questions, so you can technically rate an apple from 1-10 and  have an NPS score.  If it works for them, and keeps their customers loyal and their decisions valid, no need to lose sleep over it.	None	I get your point.  0-6 is unacceptable in NPS cause it strives to deliver perfection in service to strengthen the brand promotability. the biggest flaw NPS has are the neutrals as they get lost there and their only purpose is widening the pool. But such is intention of that formula.  CSAT is traditionally a percentage of users that had experienced great service.  CES for ease of use and so on.  I produce software to analyze performance. Traditional calculations became traditional because a lot of people started using them...  Who knows maybe your company brands their own UX formula... Again whatever floats their boat.  Simply explain to them. this is how we do it lol.  I prefer simple averages. set a target to 8,40 or 8.50, or what you feel is reasonable and thats it. then all the numbers make more sense, and you can clearly distinguish someone that rated you 1 from that who rated 6.	0

ge9hmsb	Remember the splitting of Ma Bell in 1982? Why shouldn't Amazon be broken up the same way?	They meddled in the last election more than the Russians ever did. Who appointed them arbiters of truth?	For what?	I think Google and Facebook should be broken up first.	I totally agree with you about that, and that SOMETHING needs to happen to prevent those platforms and their users from being manipulated by foreign interference in elections (in any country, not just the US) and deliberate disinformation campaigns.  But busting them up as a monopoly doesn't do this, and governmentally squashing them (in the US) is unconstitutional. The system of capitalism the US has reinforced means that if a FaceBook were to disappear for any reason, another one would pop up to fill the void, as long as there is a desire for a product, someone will make it - and who is to say the next one will be "better" - look at Parler (lol, I laugh because Parler is for the time being an impotent rage boycott of Twitter that is funded by purely political entities and speculators and will only survive for as long as it is useful - it is not a serious capitalist attempt to make money or provide a real service for its users). Getting citizens to engage in society and "citizenship" rather than choosing to only engage in a self-reinforcing safety chamber of social media and targeted (more reinforcing already held beliefs) media is really key.  We also don't want a government that is the arbiter of truth. Re-teaching people to think logically and critically (even of their own representatives and personally held beliefs), fostering transparency where possible and a free press to give citizens multiple sources of information are a few necessities to maintain a healthy democracy.  Better education for kids and citizens of all ages - especially fostering critical thinking and reasoning skills, promoting regulations that curb ad buying and targeting abuse, promoting or incentivizing transparency from corporations about certain business practices, etc... would all be a good start, but that also requires legislators that actually understand technology and have a vision that reaches farther than their reelection in four years.  This all being said, I agree in part with your original comment, just not in the context of monopolies which is what the thread topic was. Media corporations and information brokers have run rampant over the last 30 years and the US government has not kept up with  the rate of change in technology in any way. It is easy to see over the last decade how information (true or not) and the ability to spread it rapidly is a truly powerful commodity (it always has been of course, but you can no longer stop a horse and buggy full of books from reaching its destination or buy up all the papers on your block so non of your neighbors see a certain article) - we are in a world where one random and anonymous person/robot/spy/government named [@Catturd2](https://twitter.com/Catturd2) can spout off non-sense and have it amplified by a person holding what, arguably,  used to be the most powerful job in the country.	0

gedjv5k	U.S. Tax Implications of ETH 2.0	&gt;  Eth1 for Eth2 swap  You don't "Swap" your eth1 for eth2.  It's a protocol upgrade.	Law student here who has taken some coursework in federal taxation:  I would expect the IRS to release additional guidance - there is a stronger argument that Eth1 for Eth2 swap is much more closely aligned with section 1031 like kind exchanges than any previous coin swaps, and in a Haig-Simons sense, the swap from 1 to 2 doesnt generate any Haig-Simons income.  From basic tax principles that would lead us to the conclusion that the tax code shouldnt be intending to force a realization event on this swap. However, the rules arent clear. Eventually someone with enough at stake may make a formal request to the IRS for a private ruling letter (generally costs around 10k USD) that will tell us how they intend to treat this going forward.  As far as staking rewards, crypto tax girl appears to be correct - include staking rewards as ordinary income in the year it is received and include sales of the rewards in your net capital gains tax computation.	None	‘Swap’ here relating to taxes would be a legal definition question. Locking your Eth1 into a contract to effectively own Eth2 could be interpreted as a swap.  Edit: no idea why I’m getting downvoted - I agree that it is a protocol upgrade, but I’m trying to give reasonable interpretations based on past ways the IRS has handled crypto transactions. Burying your head in the sand and yelling things like FUD and maxis doesn’t mean a single shit to tax enforcement agencies. They literally don’t care.  Generally speaking when it comes to tax compliance, sometimes it works in favor of the taxpayer to plan ‘aggressively’ and other times ‘conservatively’. If you fuck up and go ‘aggressive’ when you should have been ‘conservative’, the penalties can be enormous  Edit2: apparently there’s a comment limit on this sub? Anyway - RE: the comment below this, the two chains are not currently the same thing (regardless of them being merged in the future), so the law likely wouldn’t consider them the same thing currently. A new genesis block on a beacon chain while the original ETH chain is still functioning means there are two distinct chains.	0

At this point, almost all the lands known for having the maple leaf are part of Québec. So i doubt it would still be a national symbol of this smaller country.	It honestly looks like they took the Northwest Territory west of the Ottawa River as it was in 1867 and made that “Canada” and everything that was Canada and the NWT east of the river (+Newfoundland and PEI) into “Quebec”.  It’s beyond puzzling because the circumstances that lead Quebec being displeased with confederation still exist! The circumstances being Southern Ontarians being smug WASP-y assholes!

ghrb8cj	Beginner issues with starting cycling	Wearing flannel on a road bike is incredibly liberating. I recommend everyone try it. Also, as you purchased a gravel bike, feel free to leave your leg hairs at whatever length you find appropriate.  On a more serious level; parts that rub and sit in sweat should have proper activity specific gear. Its about hygiene and skin health. I almost never wear a shammy on day-to-day rides, or anything less than an hour or so, though feel free to if you like. But, I still do wear rash protective shorts to prevent the chub rub. As a male, some of the cheaper end tighter fitting boxer briefs also work under whatever shorts/pants I'm wearing for the day. That's really it as far as I go. My primary bike is on flat pedals so I just wear whatever shoes I feel. My road bike has clipless, I almost never ride with socks unless its freezing. And, unless I absolutely need the extra pockets, I hate wearing jerseys. I prefer regular t-shirts.  Beyond hygiene and safety concerns, the only thing I'll say is that sometimes a "proper" kit will make people less likely to think you're a repeat DUI offender. If you care about that sort of thing.	>DO NOT WEAR FLANNEL for rides  ha, luckily I don't own flannel, lol	Most "real cyclists" will tell you "ride your bike", hell I don't trust a rider who judges people based on speed or on their gear. Secondly its natural to feel jealous about other peeps gear and bike, that's why we have N+1(the number of bikes you should own ) and constantly browsing websites looking at the latest specs and stuff. Lastly , most of the time you can find good gear for relatively cheap ( Blackbibs > Rapha ) , but remember don't skimp on the important stuff ( groupset if your upgrading and clipless shoes and shammy ) and whatever you do ,i say this as a road only rider , DO NOT WEAR FLANNEL for rides , cause it makes us lycra rodies jealous AF	I have used the padded shorts twice, and I find them so much more comfy, but obviously I don't use them for cycling around the city! My bike has flat pedals, because that is why at I am used. Since I also never used drop bars before this bike I didn't want too change too much at once.   Out of curiosity, what does non "proper" kit have to do with DUIs?	0
ghrbwl9	Beginner issues with starting cycling	Even just an inexpensive, small handlebar/toptube/seatpost bag can be useful if you don't care about killing a ride at fractions of seconds. Having a place to put keys, whatever patch/tube/repair kit applicable for your tire setup (an emergency tube is still useful even if you ride tubeless), multi-tool, minipump, etc is really helpful. Some days you feel you don't need it. Then another day you end up with 3 punctures in a 10km stretch. AKA, why I went tubeless	I ride solo. Bags are an idea I have been thinking of as well, but more for when I do long tours (which will probably take a while for me). At some point I aim to do some backpacking with this bike!	Are you doing group rides or just cursing around solo?  When you’re solo your look doesn’t matter at all. Shorts over leggings and a jacket is a very cool look- especially on gravel.  You just gotta own it. Also if you throw a few bags and stuff on your bike you’ll look more like a lifestyle rider with speed less important.	I have a little pouch/bag that goes on the seat post.   Having a problem on the way is something I think about too. I have only changed a tyre once before at a self-help kind of bike workshop. However, since most of my rides are pretty close to home, I figure that the first time this happens I won't be far from home, and I will have done it before I go on longer rides.	0

ghwrjgg	All post-diagnosis psychiatric evals use confirmation bias	In many cases parents and school systems force children in psychiatric care for false claims based on fascist beliefs that deride civil "disobedience".  The most common diagnosis among children is ADD/ADHD and the most common diagnosis among teenagers are Bipolar, Depression and Anxiety.  Sounds like they're just attempting to use the system to control children not only with drugs but by limiting their social and legal options as a form of punishment and as a control mechanism.  Then peers and bully-culture can things worse.

"Even if you believe I am wrong about this, name one time even one psychiatric worker demanded a person be free of all legal accusations of mental illness when there wasn't enough objective information to accurately diagnose someone."  Eh, this frequently occurs on the consultation-liason psychiatry service. Frequently non-psychiatric physicians will consult psychiatry for "depression" when a patient is having a normative reaction to medical illness, or consult for "new onset psychosis" in a medically-ill delirious patient. If the patient does not meet criteria for a mental illness, then no diagnosis is given (or something like "psychological factors affecting other medical conditions" for billing purposes).

gibf69y	homesteading	Years ago I remember getting a wool hunting jacket as a hand-me-down from a dead relative. It smelled funny and was scratchy, felt stiff. I think I ended up donating it.  Last month I went out with an experienced hunter. We were tracking bucks in snow -- warm enough while moving, too hot if anything, but we hit a patch of white oak with lots of feeding sign and decided to sit. Our extremities started going numb within about 20 minutes.  I asked him: "How the hell did the old timers stay warm?"  He answered: "Wool. Lots and lots of wool."  And I immediately felt like an idiot. As soon as COVID is over, I'm going to start hitting the thrift shops for wool clothes.	I camped out by myself in a park last October. Hiked miles in and pitched the tent. Im in New England. I had camped with others in a survival setting but not by myself. It was cold and heard various noises through the night. It was a mental test more than anything and I had the idea to trek back home in the middle of the night, but I toughed it out and made myself warmer with a Mylar blanket.

gicp0et	Nearly 30% of working professionals would quit if they had to return to office after pandemic	&gt; If you aren't in STEM with a graduate degree at least then you shouldn't be excited to work from home.  How much is this a real protection when Eastern Europe, Central and Eastern Asia are producing highly specialized STEM graduates in high numbers that will work for less?	I have been WFH for years. I'm lucky enough to be specialized. If you aren't in STEM with a graduate degree at least then you shouldn't be excited to work from home. You're replaceable, simple as that.	And the proles will continue to buy the rope by which they hang themselves.    Having to be in a physical space affords you leverage in a world of wage differentials.  If a firm is happy with you being 100 miles away from the center it will be more happy with someone 10,000 miles costing them significantly less.     >Forty-two percent of the U.S. workforce has been working from home full-time during the pandemic, according to a Stanford University study.  Wow.  Staggering.	A someone that has both worked with corporations that have branches in eastern Europe and spent a brief stint doing my own consulting which involved hiring from certain asian countries strictly due to the low cost, I'd put my money down that it's solid protection.   What people who haven't been as close to the cheaper competition might not be privy to is the lack of common culture, time differences, language barriers, difference in quality of work, difference in work ethic, etc. that come along with outsourcing/a global work force. I'm not saying that one county has better people than the other, there's talent to be found everywhere, but there are differences - sometimes tangible and measurable and sometimes not (as in the case of common culture for instance), which absolutely play into whether or not it's feasible to pay less.	0

gih3exg	What is the correct translation of Psalm 22:16?	[Indeed, it does](https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3716&amp;context=byusq).	I didnt think the DSS had this verse. Do they?	There’s a textual variant regarding “pierced” my hands and feet or “like a lion at” my hands and feet. Ka’ari means “like a lion,” whereas ka’aru means “to bore through,” or “to pierce.”  The majority of texts we have are Masoretic (AD 900ish) and use the “like a lion.” But the oldest manuscripts (Dead Sea Scrolls, 200 BCish) use “pierced.” Pierced is also used in the Septuagint (before the time of Christ) and the Syriac translations.  Given that “pierced” makes more sense contextually and is older, it seems most likely correct. But many skeptics like to appeal to the alternate “like a lion” because the phrase “they have pierced my hands and feet” is so obviously a prophesy of Messiah’s crucifixion.  While on the cross, Jesus quotes the first verse of Psalm 22, indicating it is indeed about Him.	Wow, thanks!	0

We all know that's true, & it is unacceptable."	I mean, they were already shooting people in the face and permanently blinding some with rubber bullets for peacefully protesting. What's to say that it wouldn't get worse if black people stormed the capitol?	Treated differently =/= mowed down like most of the twitter people seem to be implying. I'd agree they'd be treated differently, I disagree they'd be gunned down in the street. There's an important distinction here.

Each project will have thousands of tasks, though.	I'd avoid this structure, personally. My recommendation would be to use nested serializers to serialize the relationships, if there is a small amount of related objects. So in this case if a organization has 2 projects and each project has 3 tasks, just get that data from serializers when you retrieve an organization	None	None	0

gilzb8b	What is the correct translation of Psalm 22:16?	It’s absolutely a Messianic psalm with lots of elements that refer to Christ. The reason “they have pierced my hands and feet” is such an incredible verse is because crucifixion hadn’t been invented at the time of its writing.	I personally agree with you that its pierced but genuine question for you (not rhetorical haha) even if it was like a lion like skeptics want to argue.. couldnt you argue other messianic prophecies in Psalm 22?   Ive heard arguments for the But I am a worm as the word worm in Hebrew is the same word for crimson and scarlet because in ancient times the little worms were crushed to extract a reddish dye. And a description of crimson in the Bible was historically associated with sin.  I think Psalm 22:6 prophesies Jesus being a worm, crushed for crimson aka sin - is just as strong as a prophecy as 22:16 (just a little less obvious).   So even if it was like a lion I think the worm verse would still be a valid prophecy of His death + an additional reason why Jesus would refer to the passage while on the cross. Thoughts? Am I on the right track? Im new to this subreddit :)	There’s a textual variant regarding “pierced” my hands and feet or “like a lion at” my hands and feet.

gioruag	First Gen Ryzen Overclocking	So is overclocking worthless if I value single core performance?	That's just the way manual overclocking goes on ryzen. The chip loses the ability to control itself the same way it does under stock conditions. But on the first and second gen chips that had lower boost clocks, you can often get a similar or better all-core OC. The first gen parts are safe up to 1.4v, just make sure you have the cooling and the motherboard to handle it.	None	Not necessarily. Maybe you have a midrange gpu or better and boost clocks only reach your max turbo on a single core, the rest will sit at lower frequencies which might impact 1% lows. So you might be getting 150fps in the game you play with PBO. But a manual OC may only be 100mhz lower than your max boost clock, but now you're getting that across all cores. So you drop to 148fps, but your frame-times improve. That was my experience and I felt like it was worth losing the 100mhz for better frame-times. Depending on your silicon, you can probably reach 3.7-3.8ghz all core. Those first gen chips still had plenty of headroom. 1.4v daily is safe, if you have the cooling and the motherboard to handle it, you may as well try overclocking.	0
gippfbe	How to find repeated subgraphs in a DAG?	That idea is similar to the weisfeiler-lehman test (specifically with k=1), and the test itself can never capture the full information you need to be sure that the graphs are isomorphic, there's a lot of literature about the test if you want to learn about it.	I am thinking that it is possible to compute hash per vertice based on its immediate surroundings of size somewhat less than the minimal size of subgraph. Then group based on such hash.  &#x200B;  Assuming that subgraphs have vertices "deep enough" in subgraphs (not immediately connected to outside), or that such subgraphs would typically align to each other.	I think that the only way is to brute force it, because I'm pretty sure this a harder version of the graph isomorphism problem. Unless, somehow, being a DAG helps a lot, which afaik doesn't help a lot.	None	0

git4eke	Temp banned from r/DataIsBeautiful for a comment stating what numerous scientific bodies have entertained.	&gt;B) Being called a conspiracy theory.  &gt;In what world is the suspicion that COVID is following a seasonal pattern a conspiracy theory? I’ve seen numerous sources, pro or anti lockdown, say as much.  There is an essay written about 20 years ago by a philosopher David Coady, that I think offers the most lucid treatment of why this happens.  This is it: [Conspiracy Theories and Official Stories](https://www.pdcnet.org/ijap/content/ijap_2003_0017_0002_0197_0210)  In summary, he correctly argues that the term really means not believing in official stories.   Not believing in claims about the nature of this virus, or the efficacy of interventions that are disseminated by governments, international bodies and private foundations  by the mainstream press is precisely why this term is used and has such power in our discourse.	I thought I would bring this up here. Its an example of an opinion which isnt even divergent from current scientific discussion  A) Being taken as a factual statement. My tone was assertive, sure, but I wasnt passing off a fact any more than someone saying cases will explode this month was.  B) Being called a conspiracy theory.  In what world is the suspicion that COVID is following a seasonal pattern a conspiracy theory? Ive seen numerous sources, pro or anti lockdown, say as much.

giz26us	What's your favourite "Shut up Leonard" line?	Lol yeah when he doing those push-ups and make hard eye contact with her, it was great to see her response.  But that's the thing I don't often see discussed about Annie. She fell for virtually anyone who she suspected had fallen for her.  With Jeff (various times) With Abed (As Don Draper AND Han Solo) With Troy (after he sent Brita a text to get her to stop liking Blade) With Micro Nipples (Vaughn) And there with the Dean.  I contend that it wasn't his confidence that made her swoon. It was the affirmation she received from all these guys placing value on her. This is also consistent with her while arc. She sought validation in high school from Troy and her peers and mentally never matured out of being the ugly duckling.	And Annie finds herself suddenly attracted to the Dean for a brief moment.

gj60nzt	With the recent news, is your hope for a KOTOR sequel/reboot renewed?	I think they probably *should* canonize the characters, but there would definitely be some grumbling. The hair and what not should be customizable, but I honestly think they should pick their actors and base the character models on said actors.  [in particular, I love BossLogics take on Gabriel Luna as Revan.](https://twitter.com/bosslogic/status/1202943143047385088?s=21)	Just no pre-made character. I don't wanna play female Exile.	Remaster the original games for easy money, restore the lost content and proper ending to KotOR II, then make a KotOR III in the original KotOR style where you can pick between playing Revan or Meetra to complete the story. Have one canon ending that neatly tied up both stories.   After that, Disney would have a nice, already beloved playground to expand in *outside of the Movie Era*.	Canonizing is a problem, especially with RPG games where they give you the power to customize. Making anyone canonically male or female takes away from personal experience of the player, I think, and it just isn't RPG anymore, it's an adventure with dialogue choices. For me, Revan is female and Exile is male. Why? Because Revan is an awesome character, strong and admirable. She resisted the fall to the Dark Side because, let's face it, women tend to be more calm and thoughtful when it comes to business. Plus, Revan makes for one hell of a strong and interesting heroine, not like the Mary Sue perfect character that was Rey. Why the Exile is male? Because his story actually makes more sense in the game. He's the guy who activated the goddamn Shadow Generator thingy and killed who knows how many. In woman's nature is to be a diplomat and a peacekeeper so I don't see a female Exile doing this. Secondly, Atris' downfall makes a lot more sense with the male Exile, considering it's implied she has feelings for him. Thirdly, Handmaiden joins only if you're male and she's kinda better than Mical. The mother/son relationship between Kreia and male Exile is also better. In a way it makes more sense for FemRevan and BroExile. But, whatever, if I'm gonna be labeled a sexist here, at least I'll share my views.	0

gjbbbmg	First Independence Poll of 2021	EU citizen here ... you're absolutely right about US polling - IIRC i even saw some claims that the 2020 US election polling accuracy was worse than in 2016. Not surprising.  However, these polls aren't just random one-off results. SNP has been "the" independence party for years, and if you look at *actual* elections - most recently the 2019 UK general election - SNP got 45% of all votes and 48 out of 59 seats. Plus there have been multiple other occasions - 2014 independence vote etc - where you can see the trend very clearly.  So.... i'd say these polls are very much in line with reality as measured by actual elections and referendums.	American here who went through multiple insane elections- dont trust polls.  Too many trolls fuck with the numbers for fun and many people are dishonest with poll workers for whatever reason.    If you really want this the only way to get it is massive voter drives.  Educate people, ensure theyre able to vote and that they actually do vote.  Stacy Abrahams and her crew in Georgia show what can happen with serious dedication and effort.

gjbn6xa	Python script to detect range/sideways trading markets	I think his code is for detecting one specific case of mean reversion (a trading range) not for detecting mean reversion generally.  i.e., a data set could be classified as mean reverting by hurst but still occur with price action that isn't a classical range bound scenario	Isn't hurst exponent for exactly this, finding if data is trend following or mean reverting?

Would it then be lawful the re-submission of the post without any links to private social media accounts? Are links to professional accounts such as those found on Linkedin allowed?	Regarding our rules, this does not appear to be something that would be allowed since this would not be considered professional contact information of a public figure, per the section you bolded.

gjdx4ad	Accurate representation	&gt;Acid can help break through metal  Oh no no.  The real trick is using concentrated mana. Concentrated mana does not damage you, but eats metal like the steel walls and damages turrets. And if it touches water, which is abundant in the base, it turns the water into mana as well.	Acid can help break through metal, and explosive shots like Lightning Bolt help with turrets and sentries.  Pick your fights carefully and don't be afraid to run. Hell, use the terrain to your advantage if you can. Hissi only shoot if they have a clear line of sight, even the arcing shots. Take potshots if you can, and break em' down steadily. The big bosses are a pain because they spawn things when hit, but hey, more gold. Something powerful with AOE can help, but basically... If you got to the Hissi base with a struggle, it's gonna be rough. I got past it once, and that was with a REALLY good wand and a whole mess of lightning bolts PLUS infinite water and lightning immunity. I basically just electrified EVERYTHING	How do you get through Hiisi Base? I get there most runs but die a couple minutes in every time.	Huh, I actually didn't know that! I'll keep in mind.

gjgpaj5	Angry customer texts me after accepting an order.	&gt; if it had bounced around, then there would be no way to know before accepting   Maybe on GH or UE. But DD is incredibly hesitant with increasing pay on orders that have been bounced around. Bounced around orders tend to have payouts like $3.75 or something	If it had bounced around, then there would be no way to know it before accepting. Now, you could say "stop delivering orders with a garbage tip." That would make sense, since the immediate text about where their McDonald's food is would be a good hint that they didn't tip.	Stop accepting orders with a garbage tip	All depends on how many Dashers are available in your area. I only work the suburbs. I get a few orders each night with high DD pay, because the customer didn't tip. I can always tell, because their pick up and delivery times are pretty much immediate. I just text them to let them know I just accepted their order, and I'm heading to the restaurant. If they text back any kind of anger, then I unassign.   I only do DD and GH. UE is garbage in my area. I'm signed up, but I've never had a single order worth taking. Had it on for 5 nights. GH is nice, since you can see if the customer tipped after accepting the order. I don't really care, since I only accept when the payout is nice. It does come in handy for when you get an asshole text from them. You check and see no tip, add in the asshole attitude, and it's an easy unassign.	0

gjhcjta	Number of COVID-19 cases linked to Crackers bar in Saskatoon up to 56	So, correct me if I’m wrong, a large amount of this 56 could be directly patrons of this establishment?  Even if not, how much household (and other) spread will this subsequently cause? My point is: household spread is an issue, but it’s been evident that it is merely a symptom to a bigger issue since it derived from outside the house first, and many of us have been aware that we are failing to deal with the actual problem.  Second point: people who engage in these types of behaviour already, despite restrictions, are unlikely to be cautious in other areas (going out to other places, not holding small number of contacts, not wearing masks often, not being mindful of what they are in contact with). This is likely to have large repercussions and it’ll be against a lot of people who have been doing the right thing.	SHA spokesman Doug Dahl said he could not immediately identify how many of the 56 infected people visited Crackers and how many were contacts of those people. The original notice from the SHA about Crackers warned of significant risk for potential second generation spread.	None	None	0

gjiuk65	Good news guys, Epic is looking into the issue	That's a good default assumption, since at the end of the day they are a company and their main goal is making money.	The cynic in me can't help but think they've just had to issue more refunds than they were expecting, rather than whatever PR spin they wind up going with.	None	This is certainly true in a long term sense, but I don't think Sweeney is worried about the Epic Games Store making a lot of money this year, or even necessarily in the next 5 years. Between Fortnite and Unreal Engine licensing the company has more money than God to throw around right now, and with the free games and coupons and all that shit on EGS you get the impression they're more interesting in getting people interested in the store now than they are immediately turning a profit. Cancelled preorders are bad, but more than the lost immediate sales they're probably more concerned about losing potential future EGS customers. Even if a fix to make the Hitman 2 content free for previous owners costs them money in the short term, doing it would still line up with their current business plan	0

gjmlnf9	Honda Clarity vs Hyundai Sonata PHEV	It sounds like you're doing long trips with a flat battery.  Manually use HV mode during long trips so that you maintain 70-50% battery. The car is far more efficient when it has some battery to work with.  As a bonus, the car will still operate in EV mode even after you've run the gas tank dry, so there's no reason to pull over to find gas when you've got 80+miles (2gal) of fuel left.	I'm not familiar with the sonata phev, and L/100km is a brand new unit for me that makes my head hurt. The 50ish mile range of clarity is perfect for my commute and I love getting gas once every 3 months or less frequent. As a commuter car, clarity is perfect for me.  The few times I travel over 200 miles, it feels weird having to pull off the highway to get 5 gallons of gas. I do wish the clarity has a larger tank. If you do a lot of long range driving, the 7 gal tank is awkward. You can't trust the electric range at highway speed. You don't want to risk running out of gas so after 5gal or 200ish miles, you are looking for gas.	None	None	0

gjpf1ok	Where to find an internship with no experience	Now is a good time to start messaging them though for the same reason. They may have more free time on their hands to answer messages so something could be set up down the road.	The natural place to begin is to get in touch with your local university's anthro department.  (Depending where you are, this might work better post-COVID). Get in touch either with their office or directly with a professor who's doing work that sounds interesting (you can usually find bios with research interests and contact info on the department's home page). Tell them about yourself and ask if they have use for an intern. They're busy people and might ignore you - in which case don't take it personally - but there's a chance someone might have something you could do, or can point you towards local organizations. If you know anyone (parent, parents' friend, teacher) who went to college locally and might have a contact there, that would help.  I'd also suggest going to anthro-related events put on by local universities, museums, etc - guest speakers, film screenings, etc.  - and try to meet people and express interest in person.

gjqjw3w	5950X build. I want ECC RAM. Suggestions on a motherboard and RAM	&gt;X570D4U-2L2T  Strongly Considering this board.  Main concern is expandability via PCIe slots.  I may want to add an HBA for more SATA / SAS ports, and I am definitely putting in a GPU for Plex streaming.  Also want as many M.2 ports as possible.  Seems like a high end gaming motherboard will be my only option with this processor.	I'm guessing this is for a server build. Take a look at Asrock X570D4U-2L2T.	None	First of all you won't get more slots even if you buy a high end gaming motherboard since you will need a GPU for booting, a 10gige NIC for NAS, so those 2 things will take up 2 slots (while the X570D4U-2L2T comes with a built-in GPU for booting, and 2 10gige NICs). And X570 platform only have 24 PCIe lanes (2 x PCIe x8 4.0, 2 x M2 PCIe x4 4.0).  With X570D4U-2L2T you will be able to use 2 x M2 / U2 PCIe 4.0 SSD (U2 via M2 to U2 adapter) and 2 x PCIe 4.0 x8 cards, plus you already have 4 NICs onboard 2 x 1 gige, 2 x 10 gige.  A Quadro P2200 would go nicely with this setup, tho you might not even need a GPU for transcoding since you are using a 3950x.	0
gjqmi8x	Thinking about getting a bearded dragon so I'm gonna start my research right here in this subreddit.	Paper towels are generally accepted, yes. There is no real danger presented to the dragon. The substrate conversation typically involves people adamantly denouncing the use of fine particulates like sand or calcium-infused sand. In my experience, these substrates are potentially dangerous (risk of bowel impaction) ONLY if you feed the dragon directly on the substrate. Vets will tell you impaction is very uncommon in otherwise healthy dragons.	Alright good to know, thanks. But maybe you can help me out with one thing, there are so many pictures with people using paper towels instead of substrate. Is that at least a thing everybody is okay with?	Let me stop you right there...getting information from this subreddit is a sure fire way to ensure you have absolutely no clue what to do. What will happen is you’re going to start an argument between 100 different internet “experts” all convinced they know what’s best for you. Use veterinary sources to guide your thinking.	None	0

gjr9itn	Double RM roles	Claim space drastically drops when there's the same RM roles, all it would take is a lookout and spy paying attention or a decent invest that doesn't die n2 after posting. Some combos can work but most of them result in maf being underpowered and easily taken out. ALL of coven roles are unique and never overlap like mafia roles do. It's a simple fix and it increases claim space for evils which is actually good for the game. Currently most people either throw or instantly leave when they get mafia roles.	I had a 2 disguiser game and it was amazing.  If there was a spy, they would have been so confused.  I don't see why two of the same rm is that much worse, and if they were never the same that would give town free information.	None	With 2 disguisers, you can make yourself look like another role and confuse lookouts and spies. With 2 forgers, you can easily change the claim space and get other people sussed. With 2 blackmailers, you can easily silence TIs or other people who would call you out. With 2 consigs, you can confuse town when there are multiple invest claims, and get the real ones lynched, and although it's a bit harder with a spy, consigs can alternate their targets at different nights. But 2 framers is quite meh, I gotta say, because it only fools sheriff, which might not even be in the game. 2 janitors is only good for nerfing retri even harder. I actually quite like having 2-3 of the same mafia role because people don't expect it, it throws them off. It's not that bad to have 2 same roles in mafia, there definitely some good strats you can pull off.	0

Can it be abused? Yup, Which is why you should follow the guidelines I just listed. The reason I say take 8 is because at max you have 000 Capsules, One 000 capsule is equivalent to about 1 gram. So, if you took 5 you most likely took 5 grams or less, won't do much. 8 grams is about the dosage most go with.

gjthrnj	Weekly Question Thread	They'll only attack innocent buildings if they try to make a base directly on it, or you make a wall of them and that get stuck.  As for your death trap. Some options:  * Run around, pick up as much useful stuff as possible and migrate on foot/car/tank to somewhere safe, preferably on an iron mine, and research what you need while they eat your base. * Hand craft turrets and make some ammo assemblers. Even a basic turret with red ammo can make light work of basic biters. Plonk these on the parts getting attacked, or place them near currently attacking biters, then run up, shoot and draw them back to the turrets. This would work even better if you have laser turrets, no ammo needed. * Pick a fall back area that has everything you need, and fortify that with turrets. Deconstruct what you can outside that, and let the biters eat the rest. * Turn off your power or take down power poles to separate 90% of your base. Less power, less pollution. Get a mini military science going and use some hand crafted efficiency modules to keep pollution and energy cost down.  Depends exactly what you've got and where stuff is how I'd do it.	I have situation with my current playthrough. I neglected base defenses way too long and have basic green,red,yellow and purple setup going on. I thought i had time to setup better turrets around my perimeter and all, but are now in a situation where my resources, speed or save files cannot save me from impending attacks on multiple sides with grown biters and i'm just one man with flamethrower.  in these situations what is your solution, migrate base to different location, just survive/kill nests with big losses and rebuild/fortify there or just restart? I don't really look for solution to my bad base per se, just different opinions how people solve these kind of situations.  Other thing, i've seen time and time again people fortifying only base and outposts, don't biters attack rail tracks at all or what?	None	Good points all around. Thanks for the insight.  I usually go for the laser+solar for simplicity, but was going bold with achievements this time (NTFC, hailing bullets and steam all the way), but it bit me in the ass (literally) it seems. One of the reason i ignored defenses is because i rushed research for NTFC and thought i would be fine.  Migration seems to doom my 15h achievement as it is already in the point of no return to start fresh, but i could still keep that save for later and bunker down to smaller setup for awhile, could be interesting challenge.  Also, i love the term death trap!	0
gjtp9yl	Proof?	Countless countries that have attempted lockdowns and seen no correlations between degrees of lockdown severity and degrees of disease spread. The fact that there exists island nations with no transport hubs that have yet to have covid spread throughout their countries (and they will) does not equate to lockdowns doing anything, particularly in countries where the disease is very much present.	Lockdown seems to have helped in Melbourne	You make all these points + the fact that there's no evidence lockdowns do anything anyway, and they still manage to come back at you with some variant of   "Grannies are dying you ScIeNcE-DeNyInG MONSTER".	Hmm well we do seem to largely only be receiving cases from overseas atm, rather than community transmission. So even if its not done anything, closing down borders was certainly a wise choice.

I constantly end up placing the cards too close together when I put them in the row, and they end up stacking.  I don't suppose there is a way of disabling stacking of cards that have their picture side up?	Players client side can set their rotation increments to 90 degrees. And you can set the grid in Options per game save. For card games I recommend 51%-75% of the width of the card, depending on how square their aspect ratio are.  If there is only one row of cards you can actually set the hands to visible to all players and widen their scale using the gizmo tool(F8)	None	Try setting the grid to a third the size of your cards width that may help  In OPTIONS>GRID	0

gju3u6f	ADADADADADADADADADADADA M1	&gt; Didn’t even let the cops do him in.  Well that makes sense. The cops are annoying when you're trying to PvP with people, and killing yourself is the easiest way to get the cops off of you.	Thats always the dumbest thing. Once got in a fight where if the guy ever got cornered he would just kill himself. Didnt even let the cops do him in. Then he was bragging he had a higher kd. Thats when I felt bad about getting into this fight with someone who had double digit IQ score	i never do sniper battles but someone was on a building trying to kill me and i hit them once with the explosive bullet then the person killed themselves🤦🏽‍♂️a reason why i don't Pvp	None	0

gjufe7b	As a send-off, here's every Donald Trump joke from the show.	Well done! Thanks for making it!	Hi, I made this video 4+ years ago, and it still bothers me that I missed 2 references:  1. In Segment 5 of 204-Catalina Caper, when reading a letter of a wedding invite, Crow says "It's the Trumps and its in New York."  2. In Segment 4 of 320-The Unearthly, Joel is reading the directions of the Bots' board game and says "Each player starts out with a billion dollars and half a dozen hotels, but immediately loses them when they dump Ivana for Marla."  My apologies.	None	None	0
