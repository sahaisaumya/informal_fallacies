c08elw7	More women needing cash go from jobless to topless	BLOODHOUND GANG, FUCK YEAH!	It's interesting that the supply/quality of strippers may increase in a recession.  One might argue that it's because woman that were previously "above" stripping are now forced into the market.  Another point may be that the lap-dance is always better when the stripper is crying.

c0broqe	Peter Schiff: "You can take the Cash for Clunkers strategy and apply it to other areas, we can destroy our homes, why don't we burn our furniture and tear up our clothing, there are allot of things we already have that we can destroy and go in to debt to reacquire".	Close the loop!	Cars aren't energy free to produce.  As a quick-and-dirty estimate, it takes about 1000 gallons of energy to make a new car.  Keeping an old car running, even with worse mileage, could well be better for the environment. Reuse, Reduce, Recycle.	Umm...  they're incentivising the purchase of newer, more efficient cars, saving each consumer to do so over 500 gallons a fuel per year (the minimum amount allowable is around 545). Factor in the fact that 252k vehicles have been traded in under the program, and it means that a minimum of 137454545 gallons of fuel would be saved per year. Meanwhile, this is helping the auto industry (including the dealers) and the auto scrapping industry. Similar incentives also exist to update inefficient water heaters, air conditioning units, and home insulation.  If anything, this program is working too well, and that's why Conservatives hate it.

c0mujsk	Atheist Michael Newdow Intellectually Demolishes Arrogant Moron on Fox News	The majority of the articles posted in /r/atheism and /r/politics belong in /r/circlejerk.	This belongs on http://www.fox.com/r/circlejerk	None	I bet if you complain some more it will change.	0
c0muloi	Atheist Michael Newdow Intellectually Demolishes Arrogant Moron on Fox News	You clearly can't produce a decent argument yourself because you are begging the question. In case your wondering, this means the truth of your conclusion is implied in your premise(s).  Since you don't indicate how Newdow demolished Kelly, I can copy and paste the statement right back at you. If you can't see that Kelly flung Newdow's arguments like ragdolls to the floor and danced upon them, then you are unable to distinguish a strong argument from a weak one.	If you can't see that Newdow flung Kelly's arguments like ragdolls to the floor and danced upon them, then you are unable to distinguish a strong argument from a weak one. Upvoted.	First of all, it's intellectually dishonestly to be so biased in a headline (or in the title of a submission). Secondly, Newdow did not demolish her. If he demolished her she would be speechless, stuttering etc... when in fact the host was able to put up a decent counterargument. Regardless of who you think won this debate, Newdow didn't demolish her.  Downvoted.	Kelly could not answer the question as to what constitutional difference there was between saying "One nation under Jesus" and "One nation under God."  She refused to address Newdow's point about why the constitution protects the rights of minorities, and continued only to assert that since 95% (wrong figure) of the country believed in God, this sort of behavior was admissible, as the majority should not bow down to the minority.  When Newdow confronted her with the problem of segregation with regard to majority rule, Kelly also refused to address the question and only asserted that since the government had made no ruling declaring the pledge unconstitutional, that no complaint could possibly be lodged. These are not counter-arguments, these are repetitious assertions.  Now have I outlined this clearly enough for you or do you need more specific information?	0
c0nc3uz	Vatican: Pope has immunity in abuse trials	Well we could still go in with force.

c0nff0t	On Traveling [pic]	Wrong. Even if the statement was false, it would still be wrong. Libel is making a false statement resulting in financial loss due to distributing it to media. Slander is when it's said to a person, without any intent to distribute it to media.	it's already slander, by posting it on the internet, it's no wonder he doesn't want to go out in public slandering people	Make it into an actual shirt, then we'll talk.	**slander**    1. *Law* Oral communication of false statements injurious to a person's reputation.    2.

c0o9amz	Embarrassing Vatican letter hailing bishop who hid   predator priest	Yeah I guess you're right. I like /r/skeptic and /r/freethought a lot more so I'll unsubscribe and won't bother /r/atheism again.	I would like another subreddit for all of you people who come to /r/atheism to complain about /r/atheism, maybe /r/atheismsubredditconcerntrolls might be a fitting name even though it might be a bit long.	Rather than posting all these these articles I think there should be another reddit called /r/religionbashing or a reddit designated specifically to bash the catholic church. That's all the posts in /r/atheism are now anyways.	I'm torn...  I want to upvote to show support for your decision to leave, but I should down vote because this conversation adds nothing, and isn't the kind of thing I want to see here.  BTW, the #2 item on the /r/atheism front page ("So I meet this guy, and we're talking..."), the #4 item ("Christian group wants to defund schools..."), and the #9 item ("I came out as an atheist yesterday") are not antireligion in the slightest.  Another few in the top 10 can be anti-religion if you choose to read them that way, but that's the fault of the current events themselves, not an intent to spin them that way.  And yeah, there are quite a few religion-bashing posts as well...  but it's not as bad as you make it out.	0
c0z1lpe	Map showing the popularity of different soft drink naming conventions in the US	Southerner 1: "I'll have a coke"  Southerner 2: "Me, too.  What kind?"

I seen the pic before but have yet to here from people who thee soft drinks exclusively "coke".  Everything is coke, like ill have a root beer coke or sprite coke?

c1cnr1p	Random dude claims he co-created my app	No wonder your app didn't sell - back then, there were only like 100 Mac users and they all blew their disposable income on their Macs.  Shoulda written a PC app...	Ah, those were the days...    My software didn't "make it" when Guy Kawasaki said he liked it and recommended it, or when MacWorld gave it 4.5 mice, or any of a number of other things...  but when I saw it show up on one of the pirate boards asking for a crack, I was jazzed.  (yeah, we had some copy protection in there =-/)  Having written the program made it much easier to come up with the crack for them. =)	when i was 13, i wrote a handful of simple games in basic for the atari 8bit.  i'd give them to the guy down the street (an adult) who also had an atari, and he'd give me hacked warez.  when i was 15, i could finally afford my 300 baud modem and join the online community.  imagine my surprise when i found all my games already online - with his name replacing mine in the credits.  good lord - how low do you have to be to steal the work of a 13 year old?	Made it real interesting to find a job when we tanked too...  since nobody was hiring Mac programmers.  Fortunately, found something and been at the same place ever since.	0
c1e6qdp	Because there are effective computations that cannot be performed by Turing Machines – What is Computation? 	The actor model is mentioned because the author of the article, Carl Hewitt, was the lead author of the first published work on the actor model (the 1973 paper "A Universal Modular Actor Formalism for Artificial Intelligence".)  He continues to promote it to the point that he gets in trouble on Wikipedia for his, shall we say, zeal.	Why is the actor model being mentioned at all? Just adding a 'write random' command to the definition of Turing Machines is sufficient.	None	None	0
c1ep85h	JavaScript must die [for security reasons]	&gt; Already been tried - the JVM browser plugin.  But that wasn't fully integrated into the browser environment - it created a largely isolated sandbox within the browser.  A big reason it failed is that it wasn't usable for controlling web pages.	Already been tried - the JVM browser plugin.  In fact it was better than LLVM in the browser, as LLVM is (by design) not portable across CPU archs, while JVM bytecode is. (Maybe PNaCl will be portable, but last I checked, they were only targeting little-endian archs.) 	I say we scrap the need of being dependent on a single language at all.  It's time we start running a secured, sandboxed, *properly managed* browser execution environment, like LLVM in the browser, or Google's NaCl.	NaCl is also an isolated sandbox.  Sandboxing is important, but you can integrate it properly so it isn't so isolated. This could work for JVM or NaCl or anything else. But it hasn't, and won't. 	0
c1iqesw	Programmer Job Security turns into a jail sentence.	The proper term would be "time bomb", but I think the problem is that the general public doesn't care about such distinctions and is already familiar with the term "virus".

c1kob47	Here's what "Enterprise Architects" who dabble in coding think about commenting the source code.	PeopleSoft, SAP, anything by Oracle...  	Please list these pieces of software.  There is a metric shit ton of crap 'amateur' software out there to.	That would explain why every piece of "Enterprise" software I've had the misfortune to use has been an utter pile of crap.    Real engineers comment code responsibly, format it well, and keep it crisp and to the point. Well-named functions can give you the "how," but they seldom give you the "why."    Enterprisey wannabes apparently have more important things to do than write good, effectively commented code. And, dear God, it shows.    Whining about how comments are always out of date just shows irresponsibility. If your co-workers are fucking things up, grow a pair, clean up the mess and be a damned role model.	Ever think it might just be that one software house then?  Shit software is shit software, whether its enterprise or not.  At least enterprise software companies have an economic reason to not screw it up...support costs.  They often employ large swathes of people to manage quality, something non enterprise / freeware developers do not have a budget for, and often they suffer for it.	0
c1l7x87	Why do ads for s/w engineers always say they “offer a fast-paced environment”?	Well, if you're using a language which has first class continuations, the stack is exchanged every time you invoke a continuation other than the current one.	What a horrible name for a website.  Stacks may well overflow (causing you to need help), but how often do they 'exchange'?	None	None	0
c1lo1pf	Dynamic languages are static languages	Common Lisp has half-hearted static types at best.  If you're familiar with a language like ML or Haskell, which is what Harper is comparing to, Common Lisp is effectively untyped and entirely dynamic by comparison.	> I argue, that a fully expressive language is one that supports the delicate interplay between static and dynamic techniques.    Common Lisp, do you speak it, motherfucker?	None	In fairness, the same could be said of Java.	0
c5mjkn8	Misogyny in the nerd world and how misdirected frustration turns older geeks into the bullies	Whole article is bullshit. Basically says physical appearance is the reason "geeks" were bullied, not because of the their interest. That makes it so much better. Then the article criticizes them for being resentful? 	I don't even know where to start on this...  TIL the true cause of misogyny and sexism in geek culture is being awkward and unattractive?	None	Pretty much...	0
c5sl08i	Presuppositionalism, could someone break this down and do an "explain it like I'm five?" 	That's a common objection I've seen put to presuppers.  Their response is generally predicated on arguing from scripture, which is the word of god.  They know this because god revealed it to them.  Really, it's a refusal to argue seriously.  Basically, it boils down to "It's not possible to prove Christianity without assuming god and accepting the Bible as true.  Therefore, I assume god and accept the Bible as true, and thus Christianity can be proven."  If you don't make those assumptions with them, they talk in circles and ask trick questions and claim you're being unreasonable, rather than actually supporting their position.  It's the last refuge of a religion that has no further recourse.	Hmm.. I think I see. It's such a weird argument...   Wouldn't a rather large problem still be how did they arrive at *their* God? What to stop me from presupposing that Brahma gave me reasoning capacity?  	I'll give it a try.  * As a basic assumption, god exists. * God created humans with the capacity to reason; without god, you can't trust that your reasoning is correct. * Thus, any attempts to use reason to disprove god actually *prove* god, because they use a method that requires god's existence in order to work.  The problem here is, of course, why in the world I would ever accept your assumptions.  Thus far, I've never heard a good defense of why god's existence is appropriately considered a properly basic belief.	None	0
c5w75k0	The NY Stock exchange disclaims responsibility for any "other act of God" in their subscriber agreement	It is, rather sadly, a sign of how deeply ingrained religious thought is in our language.  But yes, in legal terms, it's something for which no one can be held responsible.  Actually, I don't mind that quite so much on further reflection.  "Who did that?"  "It was an act of god.  So **nobody.**"	"act of god" is a legal term of art.  It specifically refers to natural disasters that are outside of the control of human beings.    Earthquakes, floods, tornadoes, meteor strike, etc.  It is distinguished from riots and war, which are within the control of humans.  It doesn't have any overtly religious meaning.	None	None	0
c5wjb1f	"Jesus is the only religious leader who does not have a tomb." This statement is false, and I need some help showing why.	And they're pretty easily dealt with:  1. You can't have your cake and eat it, too.  If Jesus wasn't important enough for anyone to make note of, then the gospel accounts that present him as the most famous man in Judea are *false*. 2. The debate isn't about the existence of Christians.  I'm fully willing to admit that there were traditions that could be identified as Christianity.  The existence of Christians does not imply the existence of Jesus.	The two responses you get to this will be:  1. Jesus was at the time not important enough to make note of.   2. Paul writes about traditions that are in place during his time.	Don't get bogged down in apologetic twisty little paths.  The core issue remains;  * Nobody wrote about him during the time he was supposed to have lived.  This does not mean that there was not a real person the stories were based on.  What makes it important is this;  * Nobody wrote about the supposed miracles Jesus was said to have performed during the time that he was said to have lived.  This is a problem for divinity claims since the miracles are offered as proof that Jesus was not just a person but someone special or even a god.  It is not credible that nobody would write about such things.  There are more, though don't stray too far into nonsense that they likely don't care about.	None	0
c61zrcu	How exactly does prayer *time* in public schools oppress the freedoms of those people who don't believe in a God? 	Yes, there are ways to use neutral labels to disguise blatant First Amendment violations. I won't deny that. But I see nothing wrong with setting aside a space of time for students to engage in quiet contemplation of whatever form they wish.  It *can* be done right. 	This is fucking horseshit.  Also if you just set the bible in front of them and tell them that it's "philosophy time" and they don't *have* to open their "good book" that'd be fair too.  Oh yes, and if you had them come into school on Sunday for "non-denominational indoctrination time" but they could actually hum a song to themselves instead of listening to the preacher if they wanted, that'd be totally fair.	If it's called a "period of reflection" or "moment of silence", it doesn't.  Calling it "prayer time" still excludes those who *do not pray*.	No.  We aren't doing "quiet contemplation time".  We aren't doing any thinly disguised prayer time at all.  We aren't doing any fucking stupid rituals and we aren't thanking "whoever we want" for the magical creation of the universe when things get tough.  Fuck that fucking garbage.	0

But my compass has been true, and I've focused on what's going to be best for the American people,"	/r/politics should be called /r/CognitiveDissonance while Obama is president.	/r/politics is such a fucking joke. No one listens to you guys. You have created an insulated echo chamber circle-jerk cave.	None	None	0
c7bquxk	Do you reckon we're animals?	I suspect you were trying to get a response denying that we are "*just* animals", as though there's something limiting in the fact that we're animals.  We happen to be highly intelligent animals, capable of reasoning and tool use and civilization building and morality and science and so on.  That doesn't make us not animals.  It also doesn't make us any less promising a species.	I'm not suggesting there's anything wrong with that. "So what" is for you to answer.	Well, yeah.  I am indeed an animal.  I'm an ape, a primate, a member of the only extant species in the *Homo* genus.  I am a mammal, a synapsid, a chordate.  My ancestors were, at one point, fish.  So what?	None	0
c7opule	So a guy I've been friends with for years gets insanely creepy and weird whenever I get a new boyfriend. Here's our latest conversation.	Its a bit sad to see you write this after I just got done reading your thread.  The problem is, the friendship isn't built on reality.  His feelings led to the fake relationship/dates, which were built on the premise of "friendship" to hide his feelings.  There isn't a friendship to save as the friendship was never built on that.  The other person either gets what they want (relationship), continues to want a relationship beyond the friendship - pushing uncomfortably and never truly being your friend, or when his feelings disappear so goes the friendship (more rare with creepiness of the level seen in this forum).  They think they have a right to your time and love.  Have a right to have a relationship with you because they put in time and they are important.    Who cares what you want, you make them feel good things.  An analogy of the same type of thinking is with super helicopter parents (though they have more basis for thinking in that way, they still fall into the same trap), who protect their kids from harm and life experiences because the parents can't stand to see them getting hurt - even though its exactly what the kid needs.  Thinking about themselves and their own needs as the only real ones of import.	Damn, I know how this is. It's hard when your good guy friend cares about you in such a way that you can't reciprocate... trying to get in the way of your happy relationships/dates. I know damn well I can relate to this scenario. Hope you guys don't have to end your friendship over his overbearing love for you :(	None	None	0
c7pqdbe	So I've been inactive for ~6 months, can anyone tell what has happened wile I've been gone?	Well, thank you.	That was the funniest thing I've heard all day. You sir, are a **God**.

c7tgfba	This is what crazy looks like (context in comments)	Why did your great-uncle take down the memorial?  	The other family members think this woman is crazy. My great-uncle is, in fact, furious at her because she made him take down the memorial he wrote on his brother's page because it mentioned me and my full-siblings, who are technically step-relatives.	Did you get messages from other family members, or just her?	I don't think he did, because he sent me a PDF copy when he found I was hurt that the "official" memorial post (where they got control of his Facebook page and wrote to let everyone know he was gone) didn't mention me or my siblings. When he sent it, he said he hadn't got a chance to save a copy, but his brother did. So it looks like it was either taken down when they got control of the page, or it was a "take it down or we will" issue.  My ex-stepdad was the "official" son in charge of updating the page, which meant the crazy woman was, since he does nothing unless she says he can.	0
c8g1h2p	More Minnesotans were killed in fist fights than by rifles in 2011	You're not pro-gun control?

The right to bear arms comes with some limitations, just like every other right. Nothing is black and white.	What happens when you throw handguns into the statistic?   goes from 323 deaths to 6,543.   if you include all fire arm types, its 8,583.

c8ic15j	Study finds "liberals" more likely to favor targeted killings once they know it’s Obama's policy	Including Libertarians? Or are you all immune?

c8npyuj	Donna Brazile, government at its finest.	Why are so many libertarians against using force for good things? It's like you're bordering on anarchy. Plus, there's the Constitution that specifically instructs the government to levy taxes and provide for the general welfare of the citizens. Surely healthcare is strongly related to welfare.	What?

Be proud that you played a part in mass murder.	I'm a libertarian and joining the Marine Corps was the best decision I ever made. Of course I think our wars are bullshit, but that doesn't change the fact that the experience made me a much better person.	None	Ok. I will. I volunteered to go in to one of the shittier situation humanity puts itself in, I comported myself morally and i kept a level head when the bullets started coming at me. I am proud of it. I came out of the experience with a less self righteous black and white worldview. I came out of it more tolerant, more open to new ideas, more adaptable, and more capable of enduring hardship.	0
c8qobp6	One of my favorite quotes regarding welfare	&gt;But they're not starving.  Is malnutrition not bad enough? Numerous studies have shown that the poorer someone is in the US, the more likely they are to consume cheap, non-nutritious food, often high in sugar or salt.	> The argument is not "give food stamps because it's nice", but rather "give food stamps because the alternative is people starving."  But they're not starving. This is a false assumption. My ability to feed my neighbor does not change whether I choose to feed them or the government forces me to feed them. If I have the resources, I have the resources.  What does change is that I can opt to withhold resources if I feel taken advantage. The government has little interest in that, so it accumulates waste and fraud. I on the other hand will prioritize feeding starving children over "starving" able bodied men. And I may tell said able bodied that they've had enough, they need to get a job or do some work for me to make my life easier if they want my food.  Today, I get nothing in return. No credit, no thanks, no help around my life.	Except that the argument for welfare is not "compassion" it is necessity.  I know of very few liberals who make the argument that we need food stamps because it makes us feel good.  The argument is not "give food stamps because it's nice", but rather "give food stamps because the alternative is people starving."  We're not asking for compassion, merely the cessation of starvation.  The fact that allowing people to starve is unconscionable to many of us does not mean our argument is about charity.  I don't think I'm a better person for supporting welfare.  How I feel about it isn't what's relevant, just whether it's a beneficial policy.  If you want to argue the utility of the policy, we can do that.  Economic policy was my focus in undergrad.  But Penn's argument is nothing but knocking down a straw man.	And numerous studies have shown that this is driven by choice as much as cost. Giving them EBT cards loaded with cash isn't turning them to fruits and vegetables, it's just enabling them to buy more crap.  All that aside, who are you or I to decide what someone else should eat?	0
c8qocie	One of my favorite quotes regarding welfare	Take a look at the countries around the world without welfare. Take a look at history. Yes. That's exactly what happens. People starve. Don't underestimate people's unwillingness to part with their money.	So you would stand by and watch people starve then but for welfare?	Except that the argument for welfare is not "compassion" it is necessity.  I know of very few liberals who make the argument that we need food stamps because it makes us feel good.  The argument is not "give food stamps because it's nice", but rather "give food stamps because the alternative is people starving."

c8qoetv	One of my favorite quotes regarding welfare	&gt;So really, I think it's the responsibility of the person bringing the program forward to explain why that program is worth holding a gun to someone's head and forcing them to pay for it whether they want to or not.  Can we dispense with the "holding a gun" to the head sensationalist bullshit? No one's holding a gun to your head when you pay taxes.  Yes, taxes are compulsory. Providing welfare is compulsory. It's in THE FUCKING CONSTITUTION. I thought libertarians were constitutionalists. Why do you overlook the taxing and spending clause, which includes the general welfare clause?  &gt;Now the debate becomes, is "because some individuals might starve" a sufficiently good reason to use force.  YES. The alternative is eugenics. Sorry if someone has to sacrifice refurnishing their 12,000 square foot home so that some people won't die from starvation. Who could possibly answer no to this "debate" and provide any sort of ethical justification?	>The fact that allowing people to starve is unconscionable to many of us does not mean our argument is about charity.  Actually, I think you're either burning your own straw man or missing Penn's point.  When you pay for something with tax money, you're paying with money that was extracted under penalty of imprisonment.  That is, it was obtained by force.  We know this because there will always be people who are unwilling or uninterested in funding almost any given program.  But their participation remains compulsory.    So really, I think it's the responsibility of the person bringing the program forward to explain why that program is worth holding a gun to someone's head and forcing them to pay for it whether they want to or not.  Now the debate becomes, is "because some individuals might starve" a sufficiently good reason to use force.	Except that the argument for welfare is not "compassion" it is necessity.  I know of very few liberals who make the argument that we need food stamps because it makes us feel good.  The argument is not "give food stamps because it's nice", but rather "give food stamps because the alternative is people starving."  We're not asking for compassion, merely the cessation of starvation.  The fact that allowing people to starve is unconscionable to many of us does not mean our argument is about charity.  I don't think I'm a better person for supporting welfare.  How I feel about it isn't what's relevant, just whether it's a beneficial policy.  If you want to argue the utility of the policy, we can do that.  Economic policy was my focus in undergrad.  But Penn's argument is nothing but knocking down a straw man.	None	0

Yet when my husband and I badly needed some temporary help, we were told that, because we didn't have kids, we didn't qualify. My husband had just been laid off of work through no fault of his own, and I was just doing temp jobs.  But a woman who said she was working two jobs and had 6 kids that was in line before us walked in, said the $400/month she was getting wasn't enough, and within 30 minutes walked out thanking them for increasing her allowance to $600/month.  That really upset us. She was getting lots of free food money because she decided to have 6 children, but because my husband and I had chosen to wait to have children until we were financially stable, we didn't qualify for help when we needed it.

FTA:  > The Princeton Election Consortium, which I founded, only relies on polling data and does not factor in so-called fundamentals, such as campaign finances and incumbency.  From Nate Silver:  > The quality and quantity of polling has been poor. We have stunningly few polls in some states. In Colorado, for example, which could easily determine the balance of the Senate, no polls at all were published in August. And in many states, most of the polls we do have are from non-traditional polling firms, including those that conduct robopolls or Internet polls, or which have an explicitly partisan affiliation.  At this stage in the race I think Nate's method is a more accurate predictor of the final result.	FTA:  >Right before Taylor’s announcement yesterday, according to data from the Princeton Election Consortium, the Democrats had a sixty-five per cent chance of retaining control of the Senate ... as noted here, with Orman facing off alone against Roberts, the probability of Democratic control shot up to eighty-five per cent.	>If I'm not mistaken, Sam went 50/50 in the 2012 cycle[1] ...

ckohoog	TIL in 1780, up to 90% of Americans did not belong to a church.	&gt;it sort of puts a cramp in the whole "founded as a Christian nation" thing.  it doesn't, though. the english migrants who came her were, by and large, puritans, christian reformists. the sentence immediately preceding the one you cite in your headline reads:  &gt;The First Great Awakening of the 1740s increased religiosity in most of the colonies.  the great awakening was a move towards greater religiosity, not away from it. this led to people breaking ties with the traditional churches that had been established here. they were still deeply christian ... they believed they were more christian than the christians in europe. *fundamentally* more christian. the reason so many people were church-less is because the whole concept of christianity was undergoing a massive and rapid change over here, and it took some time for new sects to form and solidify, and for new churches to be established.  	There were far fewer people back then, too. Either way, it sort of puts a cramp in the whole "founded as a Christian nation" thing.	I'm not much up on American history, but weren't there just far fewer churches back then?	Perhaps many of the very first immigrants wanted a more puritanical religion, the Pilgrims certainly did (all of whom would've considered themselves members of a church). But by the time of the Revolution, most who'd come to the new world were seeking economic opportunity rather than a stronger association with Christ.  Besides, my point is essentially that if you were to speak with an evangelical today, or someone else claiming that "the US was founded as a Christian nation", and you told them that as much as 90% of the nation at its birth did not belong to a church, you'd blow their minds.  The more common belief amongst those holding such an interpretation of history is that in the past, everyone went to church and everyone was devout, and since the founding of our nation, atheists have been undermining that structure. In fact, the opposite is closer to the truth.  Edit: Thought I should also add that economics was the catalyst for the Revolution, not mass desire for a personal relationship with Jesus.  Edit 2: Additionally, The Constitution does not cite or even mention Jesus Christ or Christianity. And the Freemasons held far more power over our early nation than any single religion did. Portions of the Constitution are taken from a book the Freemasons use to inform them as to how to live a good life. That book is titled "The Constitutions of the Freemasons" and was published in the US by Benjamin Franklin. Shortly after the Revolution, all of the official states churches were disbanded.

ckq97s6	Atheist Edward Slingerland, head of $3Million study looking at the development of Religion, says that religious/metaphysical thought may be inescapable for all of us (even atheists!)	well, i've certainly had my fair share of arguments with other atheists who believe an "inner moral compass" is a real thing, or who believe in something called "human nature" (the concept even has the word "nature" in it, so it has to be real!). i've been called crazy for asking which genes are responsible for the development of the moral compass, which scientific falsifiable hypotheses have arisen regarding this compass, and which studies have been conducted to pinpoint it and to reveal how it works. ditto "human nature."  there are no answers to these questions, of course, because these things are not real; they're like plato's indwelling essences. each person who claims to have an "inner moral compass" grew up in a world with an externally imposed moral paradigm that he or she has internalized. and even if such things existed, because we have, all of us, grown up in cultures with an externally imposed moral paradigm, and externally imposed (and often contradictory) concepts of human nature, there's no control group by which we could measure anything. no falsifiable hypothesis to test.   there are no pat answers to the questions of morality, or of human nature. both seem to be rhetorical devices that conveniently possess whatever characteristics the person using them also sees in himself or herself ... kind of like god.	I think the startling discovery he is trying to reveal is that we have to resort to metaphysical claims, even if we follow no religion at all. He uses the example of human rights: how do you know that we should fight for human rights? Slingerland says it's just innate, and based in a metaphysical argument.  I too am cautious of this point, so I'm doing a bit more research on the subject: including watching Sam Harris try to answer moral questions with science : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hj9oB4zpHww	i think about metaphysical things all the time ... i just don't find myself convinced that any of it is actually real.	This externally imposed paradigm may have its roots in metaphysical claims though. He is saying you can't scientifically measure things such as human rights or slavery, and that metaphysics are the fundamental starting point for groups to rationalize their behaviors.   And there may very well be answers to these questions in a couple of years! As the title suggests, his university and various others are working over the next couple of years to try scientifically measure these ideas and their merits.	0

clc6eas	Nation’s budget deficit falls to lowest level since Obama took office "'Not since World War II, more than 60 years ago, has there been faster and more sustained deficit reduction,' Lew said. 'The American economy today is better positioned than any other advanced economy in the world.'"	Therein lies the problem.  Yes, it was dumb to blame Obama for high deficits in 2009 - *yet that is exactly what some Republicans did*:  &gt;["And since that budget was ignored," [Rep.

cljg0z5	Texas woman threatened with jail after applying for voter ID	&gt;I think that's what she was trying to do before getting yelled at by the cop  No.  There is nothing in the article that indicates she was in the process of simply surrendering her CA license to get a TX license ... and got yelled at.  &gt;She would have to forfeit her California license in exchange for the Texas license unless she wanted to take the driving and written test again  This is not a foregone conclusion - I've lived in several states, and never had to take anything other than the eye exam again.  I've no idea on TX ... but it's entirely common for state DMV offices to trust the written/driving test you took somewhere else.  We just moved my 80-year old mother to a new state, and she only had to take the eye exam.  &gt;note: as far as I know you don't have to give up your out of state license unless you are exchanging it for the local ID.  Obviously, Texas feels differently - and has laws on the books about it - based on the quotes I noted above.  &gt; I don't think its illegal to have more than one states ID  Oh, fuck yes it is.  I've been cited for that in the past in PA.

cljmasl	Texas woman threatened with jail after applying for voter ID	&gt;there is no reason for the police to be involved in her registering to vote  Forget the voting, and forget election season entirely.  She openly admitted to a government official to blatantly violating Texas law ... by being in the state for more than 90 days and not transferring her license.  I'm not making commentary on whether that is a *good* law or not ... and she can choose to ignore that law if she wishes ... but no one should be surprised here when suddenly - *imagine that* - cops think the law should be obeyed.  That's all that this is.	>Again, fuck Texas and all ... but IMO this woman is not some shining example of nefarious voter suppression at work.

Paperwork details shouldn't land people in jail though.  I'm a conservative in Texas too.  The sad fact is Californian's like this are flooding our state because of the mess they've created back home, and Democrats love to come down hard on people for trivial details.  Instead of doing it ourselves, Republicans need to guarantee bureaucracy can't be used as a weapon in case they ever take over.	0
clk6n9s	Texas woman threatened with jail after applying for voter ID	It shouldn't.  Generally, I find voter-ID laws abhorrent -- and believe our country would be far better off if we went to mail-in ballots.  Having said that, this woman was "almost arrested" not for attempting to register to vote ... but for violating a clear law on Texas' books by not transferring her license in the required timeframe.

cohdk3k	Likely GOP Candidates Say They Are Worried About Income Inequality, Push Policies That Worsen It	&gt; the GOP is essentially and philosophically indifferent to the question of "Income Inequality." That isn't their brand, and can never be given their stated commitments.  That's why I just about fell out of my bed on Sunday morning, when Sen. Cruz was trying to peddle that.  Even my wife - who doesn't follow politics quite as closely as I do - turned to me and asked "*Do they really think people are going to buy that??!?*"  Their core problem now, is the "taxing the job creators" message is a much harder argument to make in 2015 ... when were are more or less at 'full employment' now, and certainly probably will be by election time.  So they have to painfully try to recraft the message towards wealth and income inequality ... but I just don't know how you do it.  The way you transfer wealth from the 1% down to the 99%, is either via higher taxes on the 1%, more social programs that the 99% will benefit from (i.e.: Obamacare), etc.  I've no clue how they're going to try to pitch this as a feasible strategy.  If Republicans were honestly, *truly* willing to walk away from trickle-down economics and recant ... I would once again be willing to listen to them.	While I have no love for the Democratic Party, the GOP is essentially and philosophically *indifferent* to the question of "Income Inequality."

ctydvvm	If there's a 100% chance of me dying, why am I still alive?	&gt; What is the world ending or something?  Not that soon, but soonish. Let's say N is the number of humans that will ever be born. Not just those who have been born, but include those who will be born. Now picture a line of all those humans next to each other. Now, you're a random human being as far as we know. So how do we pick your place in that line? At random. Are you going to be among the first 10% in that line or the last 10% in that line? Probably neither. You're going to be somewhere in the meaty middle. Let's for the sake of argument say you're completely average and in the exact middle. This means that the total number of humans that will ever live is about 200 billion. So we have about 100 billion left. About [130 million](http://www.theworldcounts.com/stories/How-Many-Babies-Are-Born-Each-Day) people are born each year. Assume constant birth rate this gives humanity about 770 years before we go extinct. 	Wow. Shitty sounding actual science? What is the world ending or something?	There's not a 100% chance. [According to wikipedia, about 100 billion people have ever been born.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population#Number_of_humans_who_have_ever_lived). Currently about 7.2 billion people are alive.  This means that only about 93% of people who've been born have also died. In statistical science we go by a 95% confidence interval. Since 93 is lower than 95, we do not have significant statistical evidence that all humans eventually die. 	None	0
cu0k6sb	Natalie Dormer claims that men are just as objectified as women in television	&gt; They did not like the way that rape was used as a plot point or character development tool and that scene pushed them over the edge.  This point mystifies me.  Character development has been triggered by conflict, trauma, roadblocks, opponents, etc. pretty much since the dawn of real literature.  We've got Greek tragedies that feature rape ... and murder ... and incest ... and adultery ... and domestic violence ... and torture ... etc.  If someone hits a rape scene and throws their hands up in the air because a rape just couldn't possibly form or direct a character's development isn't being reasonable.  Real world rapes profoundly influence people, sometimes negatively, sometimes positively, so we clearly have countless examples in our modern world of this kind of trauma forging characters.  One of my favourite baseball players is RA Dickey, who was sexually assaulted in his youth, and now he runs camps and charities focused around that event.  We all know Sansa is going to redirect her pain towards a positive end like this, so why is it ultimately so unrealistic that they need to drop the show?	The people I know who stopped watching after that scene describe it more as the straw that broke the camel's back. They did not like the way that rape was used as a plot point or character development tool and that scene pushed them over the edge.  And re: rape vs violence, I think it's because no viewers believe that they would end up in a scenario where they were mutilated or gruesomely murdered so it's like watching something more akin to fantasy whereas the rape scene hit close to home either because they had been raped by someone they knew or because they see that as a real possibility in the future. And the odds of being raped by an acquaintance or partner are astronomically higher than the chances of being mutilated or burned alive so their perceptions are not inaccurate.	This article mentions fans abandoning Game of Thrones after last season's rape scene.. I call BS. Also, how is a marital rape scene any worse than people being skinned alive, forcibly castrated, and the burning alive of a ~10 yr old girl? No one is abandoning the show because of that one scene. If they are, then were the rapes before better because it wasn't such a sympathetic character? Boggles my mind.	None	0

Maybe it's my nit to pick, but I support people who deserve my support, not because they happen to be part of a billions wide category like "women" or "men". Even if it's comedy, it's all part of the gestalt that drives perception, right?  Edit: don't you get tired of hearing "men should ..." or "women should ..." all the time, when you know just in your personal life enough people to know repugnant men and women and also men and women worthy of admiration?  If these kinds of statements can't even survive a look around the room in a coffee shop, why do we keep them up?	Ummm.... Did you... Did you actually read the piece? Because I fail to see how your comment makes any sense in context of the essay. 	Ugh.  Can we drop the class based thinking?  "Women" includes some women that absolutely and utterly inspire people, from Madam Curie to Aung Sang Suu Kyi to Benazir Bhutto, but it also includes some women that are the vilest monsters on the planet, like Karla Homolka, Aileen Wuornos, or Elizabeth Bathory.  If you unequivocally condemn OR support an entire gender, so that individual behaviours get trumped by class membership, you're at best generalizing and at worst, a bigot.  Let people's actual behaviour determine how we treat and value them ... and then gender ceases to be relevant to most concerns.

It's still about a 1 in 4 chance for women to be assaulted or raped in their lifetime, and about 1 in 5 odds for women in college, and thats just during a 4 year timespan. 	0
cudznf0	Contrary to the "Lesbian until Graduation" stereotype, a 2011 survey found that "women with bachelor’s degrees were ... less likely to have had a same-sex experience than those who did not finish high school".	Yes, clearly all women who choose to have sex with another woman are fully-blown lesbians. No one ever does it on a lark, because they are curious, because they are rebelling, because they like the cachet of being that open-minded, to garner male attention, etc.  	It should only be surprising to people who think people choose to be lesbians. 	From the article: >To the surprise of many researchers and sex experts, the National Survey on Family Growth found that women with bachelor’s degrees were actually less likely to have had a same-sex experience than those who did not finish high school.  >“It’s definitely a ‘huh’ situation, because it goes counter to popular perceptions,” said Kaaren Williamsen, director of Carleton College’s gender and sexuality center.	You've missed the point.  Most people who have sex with someone do it because they want to.  A large number of people, who want to have sex with someone of the same sex, experience, or are aware of, discrimination, which isn't good for their mental health or academic performance.	0

Bam got elected in 2010, which means he still is an elected official until 2016 (senators in the PH have a 6-year term). So in fairness, i think this isn't some form of early campaigning.	As a filipino myself I don't know if I should be happy or disgusted. I'm 80%  sure he's only doing this because election is near and of course for money.

curtshn	Kid Ben vs Avatar Aang	I haven't seen Ben 10 in so long. I don't really remember what he was like EoS, and i never saw Omniverse.  But what do you think about who would win?	What about the other rounds?	I'll do round 1.  If we assume this is Ben once he's had a chance to control each alien for a bit, but not like, end of season 1 Ben, then I'd say Ben most likely wins, but it could go either way.  Thing is, XLR8 is tailor-made to negate Aang's biggest strength: his evasion. *But* season 1 Ben is an immature kid who will jump into a fight without thinking, which is a big problem in this fight, since Aang can easily evade Ben's attacks from most of his aliens. If Ben doesn't open with XLR8, he's committing to a weak stance.	The biggest problem with Ben in this round is that EoS he'll still mostly use the same aliens. Someone like Benwolf or Wildvine or Eye Guy could take Aang down but he wouldn't use them. The way I see it he'll use someone like Cannonbolt and lose the fight because of it.  As for Omniverse, he's going to use Feedback. There's no doubt about it. If Feedback has energy straight from the start the battle devolves into a game of volleyball with either side redirecting the other's shots. Otherwise, if Ben gets close he wins by draining Aang and blasting him with his own energy.	0
cvbygah	James McGrath defends himself against Richard Carrier's accusations that he's a liar	I'm sure that he'd be willing to update his opinions on that point given new evidence.  But his critics will have to provide that evidence first.	You're right. Just as Carrier points out, all of his critics are either insane, can't read or are prudish about semen play.	How is that a defense?  Carrier laid out, in detail, the blatant misrepresentations in McGrath's review.  McGrath's "defense" here is "Well, never mind what I said in my review, the things I've said elsewhere are different!"  And that's in response to a single point, when Carrier addressed several.  I really don't get how he can be said to have defended himself, when he nowhere says that Carrier was actually wrong.  It's like he didn't even read what Carrier wrote.  Which isn't surprising, because it doesn't seem like he's reading OHJ, either.	None	0

ExxonMobil cuts off its sponsorship and Clinton calls for a probe in to the company for allegedly withholding data related to climate change and misleading the people.	The chicken and egg question is not fully clear here.  When did the recent  reports about Exxon knowing come out?	Seriously, why is no one asking why Exxon dropped Clinton? That seems kinda important.	I don't care for Clinton, but couldn't the non renewal have been a result of Exxon knowing she would launch this probe? I just find it hard for anyone to assert one lead to the other when the opposite could be just as likely. The only way to know for sure would essentially be proving "pay to play" politics and thusly a crime. Neither side would keep proof of this as they mutually lose.	None	0

cxw6vfg	How were Christians supposed to know Jesus(As) wasn't crucified?	See my comment here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/3wh0ze/how_were_christians_supposed_to_know_jesusas/cxw6rzx  Foregoing some of Paul's Epistles, we could say that towards the end of the 1st century, some 50 years after his ascension (according to Islam and some Christian beliefs), there were some Christians who believe he did die on the cross. However, their connection to him, is pretty much non-existent. These later Christians may have well been Maccabaeans who held to Messianic ideas trying to inspire revolt against the Romans, and used Jesus as a redemptive figure of some sort.	So did the early Christians think isa (as) died on the cross or did they know he was raised? 	There are a lot of take aways from this passage of the Qur'an, but first we need to ask ourselves a few questions:  * If a man dies, does that make the man God? * If a man dies, does that man's death absolve you of your sin? * If a man dies, does that mean that what people said about him was true?  The obvious answer to all these questions is no, which is precisely why the first several hundred years of Christianity were focused on doctrinal unity (ecumenical councils) and the eventual emergence of a popular doctrine (proto-orthodoxy). The Qur'an is surprisingly clear in these verses that the people who differ about Christ's "death" are in doubt, i.e. they have no certainty about knowledge about him.   My article here covers the lack of witnesses for the early Church and covers some pretty remarkable references:  http://callingchristians.com/2015/07/09/comparison-scribes-of-the-quran-vs-scribes-of-the-new-testament-part-2/	None	0

One concern is that the anonymous nature might encourage sensationalizing the events described. However, the authors believed that the anonymity also allowed for a greater chance for candid responses. They noted that rather than "showing off", many respondents seemed to be expressing some remorse or regret over their actions, which does lend some validity to the argument that people weren't showing off. Additionally, the responses generally showed similar themes as previous research has identified, which lends of credence to the belief that these were legitimate stories, rather than just people lying on the internet for points.

For me the Jewish religion like all other religions is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions. And the Jewish people to whom I gladly belong and with whose mentality I have a deep affinity have no different quality for me than all other people.

d5rzoj0	Most new jobs will go to west side, forecast shows.	Humanity living as we are is an input on climate change. Adding jobs in a suburb of one city isn't going to add to anything - it will simply move it around, not magically add to it.  The solution to altering what we're currently doing to the environment is to make more jobs, more buildings, more infrastructure; but in doing so hold the new construction to higher standards.  Require the new buildings to have a higher albedo and use more recycled building materials, get something like a westside Orange Line that goes from the Sunset TC to Tigard to break the parking lot on the 217 up (more than just the WES), to add more reasons to not use personal cars  - and to do this, you need jobs to encourage this.	If we do not have higher employment density and good paying jobs *in the city* (particularly downtown), we will continue to foster more auto-dependent suburban sprawl, more environment damage and degradation will occur (lost open space and farmland) which will continue to exacerbate climate change.  Edit: The comparison of us versus Seattle seems apropos. Development of jobs and housing/population in their central city, as far as I know, outpaced their adjacent metro cities. They have big players moving to their city from the suburbs. Do we have the similar movements that they do? If not, then what's the reason?  An Amazon type employer would completely change the face of the central city. We just don't have that presence.  	None	> Humanity living as we are is an input on climate change. Adding jobs in a suburb of one city isn't going to add to anything - it will simply move it around, not magically add to it.  This is what every single other metro area is saying. Addressing climate change will need individual entities -- whether people or governments --  to make a change. California has done great things to reduce its water consumption in recent years, and it was largely based upon individuals making a change. No more excuses.  > The solution to altering what we're currently doing to the environment is to make more jobs, more buildings, more infrastructure; but in doing so hold the new construction to higher standards.  You cannot just magically pretend that using "green" building materials and methods in any way offsets the lost farmland (soils), wetlands, and natural areas that *will* never come back. They are lost forever. Building and integrating into developments as well causes fragmentation of their ecosystems.   More job growth in the suburbs will cause an outward pressure on the UGB and it will cause more natural areas to be felled for more housing, retail, etc. If we want to preserve the livability of the metro area, we need to stop outward growth and focus almost entirely to central areas.  > Require the new buildings to have a higher albedo and use more recycled building materials, get something like a westside Orange Line that goes from the Sunset TC to Tigard to break the parking lot on the 217 up (more than just the WES), to add more reasons to not use personal cars - and to do this, you need jobs to encourage this.  Transit in the suburbs is kind of a joke. It's the only place where people *drive* to take transit.   The entire system of the suburbs is quite possibly one of the worst ideas of mankind.

d8b2vae	Those of you who have high protein diets (e.g. keto, paleo, etc), how to minimize costs on groceries every month?	I hunt for subsistence as well, but IMHO I don't think it's very frugal. Unless you have access to a firearm and are nearby property, it's not going to be very cheap. I love hunting for my own meat because it's very ethical, biologically necessary, gratifying and countless more reasons but costs can rack up quick.   You can do it on the cheap, but you won't be as effective. For example a decent rifle, optics, camo, boots, cleaning equipment, freezer to hold hundreds of pounds, the time involved, etc. all basic necessities for hunting big game like deer.   Would be interesting to see a post on hunting frugally. But for some people it's just not in the cards - you won't be able to beat mass produced meats because it is honestly the most cost effective protein sources. 	I hunt and fish. I am a subsistence hunter, which means I only hunt for meat. The cost of my general hunting and fishing license without bear, elk license, upland game bird this year was $80. That not only allows me to hunt and fish, but my conservation dollars go to support our Montana State lands and fish, wildlife and habitat conservation.  1 deer, 1 elk, a number of pheasant, a few turkeys, numerous fish, feeds more than just me for a year. It is the Ultimate Free Range meat source and I am taking responsibility for that meat source, just as when I have raised my own chickens for eggs and some sheep and goats. I don't have to worry about any commercial raising conditions. And my packaging is better and more specific to the recipes I cook. :)  That is one of the benefits of being a public landowner and we also have great stream access laws up here in MT.	None	I am a frugal hunter. Yes, there are a few upfront costs, but made wisely, can be minimal. Those initial investment costs for some equipment then get spread out over the years. You don't have to buy everything brand new, nor do you have to invest in "high tech". But aside from the hunting savings, I utilize the scouting trips as my hiking recreation, photography trips for my conservation work, my berry foraging and just outright recharge time - you can't put a price on that and the effect it has on your health.  I have been a participant at Randy Newberg's [On Your Own Adventures Hunt Talk forum](http://onyourownadventures.com/hunttalk/), a DIY hunter forum, for over 3 years. There are guys from all over the US and some abroad, that share their ideas, experiences, equipment advice, etc. For example there have been numerous discussions on camo or not? Boot recommendations, coming up with inexpensive packs and equipment.    You can learn alot, ask questions, search the forum extensively. Randy has good moderation to keep the trolls at bay (or banned). Just don't make a noob mistake and ask these guys what is the best place to hunt as your first post, kind of pisses most of them off. ;)	0

There's no denying that low carb works very well for many people, we're just still fuzzy on the mechanism beyond "it makes them not want to overeat".	I thought that's what happens when you go low carb and you lose weight from it....   Source: am low card for 6 years. Doing really well. 	I think it's mostly that a lot of carb-y foods are heavily processed or chock full of sugar. As a result, they give little nutritional benefit or satiety while being very calorie-dense. Not all carbs are like this of course, highly fibrous carbs and unprocessed are good, as well as semi-processed things like rice, but most of it is crap nowadays.  A simple part of low carb is that if you restrict carbs, you actually get less calorie dense, more satiating foods, and so you feel fuller for longer without consuming as much.	0

I find it amazing how he feels he's the "worst treated champion of all time" when A) he got a title shot on a 2 fight win streak in a very competitive division after not having fought for a year and a half, B) he's one of very few fighters to get a desk job on UFC tonight and C) he was put on the biggest card of the year co-main eventing under Conor and I assume getting PPV points.   What was so frustrating about his interview with Ariel was that he just couldn't give any examples for his controversial statements. The closest thing was saying that when people called him athletic he felt people only said that because he's black and not because he worked hard. Like, are the broadcasters supposed to specify on one of your obvious attributes of being athletic that its because of hard work?

dg6tsr2	CMV: The NRA is a terrorist organization, and it would be legal under the Insurrection act for the US to take military action against it	&gt; The majority of gun deaths are carried out by legal gun owners with no criminal records  Source?	The NRA commits terror by encouraging circumstances and laws which lead to 30,000 deaths a year  The majority of gun deaths are carried out by legal gun owners with no criminal records. 20,000 of the 30,000 gun deaths are caused by legal owners who have never been arrested.  	No.  The NRA does not use terror to stop common sense laws that would stop those deaths.  Background checks are common sense, assault weapon bans are not. With the amount of weapons in the USA and the ease of smuggling in the country assault weapon bans wouldn't do anything because you could still get then illegally.  The majority of gun deaths don't happen because someone who legally owns a gun does something illegal.  The majority of deaths happen because someone who illegally owns a gun does something illegal.  Restrictions on acquisitions are not going to stop that. Enforcement of possession laws will stop that and no politician is campaigning to do that.

There are about 300 self defense uses of guns a year. The million figure the NRA loves to cite is bullshit. I am a professor of criminology, and I have studied this topic intensely. There are no more than 300-500 times a gun is used in self defense each year, period.	Regarding that 30,000 number, 20,000 are suicides. Are you making the claim that if the NRA didn't exist that those people would not have committed suicide? Of the remaining 10,000, are you making the claim that if the NRA didn't exist, those homicides wouldn't have either? Those are claims you can't make in my opinion because people killed each other and themselves long before the NRA existed and long before we had guns. If I don't have a gun available I might take sleeping pills, etc.   Second, did you factor in lives saved as a result of someone using or displaying a gun in defense?

Anything that takes away people's god-given rights to either life, liberty, or property is authoritarian.  > If I want say "more gun restrictions" is that authoritarian  Any gun restrictions are authoritarian.  >Empowering the government to stamp out authoritarianism will only cause more of it.  Yeah, this is why I don't like my view. I don't like anything that empowers government, and giving the government the ability to silence opposing views would be a huge empowerment. 	The irony here is strong, but I'll ignore it for now.   The problem with this is "who decides what's authoritarian". If I want say "more gun restrictions" is that authoritarian.  What if I wanted to expand the powers of congress, is that authoritarian. What if I wanted "Universal health care". Is that authoritarian because "socialism".  Is increasing market regulations, and taxing the rich more than the poor authoritarian because "communism".   Empowering the government to stamp out authoritarianism will only cause more of it. 	No, it isn't. Every human being has these rights. To prevent any human being from using these is authoritarian. 	0
dgaczu7	CMV: Authoritarian views and opinions should be actively suppressed	And what gives you that special privilege? 	I never claimed that my view isn't authoritarian. Here, I'll be more specific:  People should not be allowed to spread authoritarian views **besides mine**.  	> My view is basically that **people should not be allowed to spread authoritarian views.**  That's an authoritarian view. Your position is a contradiction.	I don't get a special privilege. My view does. Because it's right.	0
dgad0u7	CMV: Authoritarian views and opinions should be actively suppressed	So, are you in favor of throwing out the US Constitution then, because what you are proposing is unconstitutional. 	> But where do you draw the line?  Yes, this is definitely an issue. I'd say that selling the communist manifesto is okay for educational purposes, but anyone organizing for an actual movement to take away rights shouldn't be allowed to organize or speak. I would block forums based on organizing, but I wouldn't block educational websites like wikipedia.  >Why not ban all forms of dissent?  Well, I'm only worried about authoritarianism. It's the highest cause of unnatural death. Some might argue that things like drug use, suicide, etc are also damaging to society but those things are consensual choices. Being a victim to an authoritarian regime is not.	But where do you draw the line? Can a book shop sell "The Communist Manifesto"? Would you block websites or forums?  And if you outlaw speech of a certain type on the grounds that it is detrimental to society, why stop with authoritarianism? Why not ban all forms of dissent?  Essentially, while there is no such thing as completely free speech, these rights need to be protected as a check on the power of any ruling structure.	Yeah, of course. 	0

dpii4ep	WTW for negatory interrogative?	I see your point. Perhaps I worded my example incorrectly.

In this case I feel like "why" is not doing the work of a question, but is part of an exclamation. Compare "I'll be damned if I'm going to hit him" where there are no interrogative words, but which carries much the same meaning. Also, if the tone is one of protest: you don't really expect to be given a rational explanation for why you should hit the third party.	None	I would call this a rhetorical question, i.e., you're not really expecting an answer, so the sentence serves some other purpose, here, as a protest or counterpoint to the first person's remark. I bet, though, that there is a more specific name for it known to grammarians, who agonize over types of sentences; declarative, imperative, and here, interrogatory.

drgia55	I really don't think Kylo vs. Rey is enough of a threat/conflict to end the trilogy. There needs to be something bigger. Thoughts?	They joined each other in the throne room imo. The movie was pretty big on perspectives. Rey saw Kylo killing Snoke to save her. Kylo saw killing Snoke as a way to ascend to power with Rey.   I feel like what they both saw had come to pass, but we’ll see. 	I think there will be something bigger that were not aware of yet. Kylo and Rey both had a vision.

The FO deployed their forces en masse to seize control of the Galaxy after the Republics destruction on Hosnian.   It’s not that there’s no one to help, they’re fighting their own battles. I’m betting once Hux stages a coup in 9, it’ll cause a division in the FO that allows the resistance to grow and take them on again. 	Agreed, but the stormtrooper revolution will show finn's arc as a full circle as he is able to make other troopers realize the wrongdoings of the first order just as he did in the force awakens idk. they all were kidnapped from birth and brainwashed to follow the first order from a young age. it sounds like fanfiction, but i think it sounds cool to see on screen	0

drngtcu	Cult of Mithras Explained	In [another video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twopr59buc), Andrew Henry mentions why he referred to devotees and the worship of Mithras as a cult. When scholars of ancient history use the word "cult", they use an older meaning of the word "cult", which is devotion or worship. Thus the worship of Mithras is referred to as the cult of Mithras by historians.	I'm sorry. I don't know anything about Mithras but i don't know where to look next.  I had an observation, watching this video. It made the cult of Mithras seem more like a fraternal order than a full religous cult.  Is that possible?	None	I don't think I'm misunderstanding the term. I'm saying that it seems as much like a religious group as it does a fraternal group. Things like mystical symbols, ancient (to practitioners at the time) or foreign religious elements, crossing of socioeconomic borders. Things like that.  That there is little in the way of religious text, even though some religious sites were discovered intact adds to the mystery for me.   I'm not educated in these areas obviously. Just curious.	0

drtr353	Today, I finished War and Peace.	&gt;It's really not an easy book to get into and will just get more difficult as time goes on and it's harder for people to relate or rely on knowledge of the period for context.  I find this ironic, since, thank's to the Internet it's easier then ever to quickly find names, places, and events and gain context. 20-30 years ago Mom/Teacher/Whoever would tell you to grab a dictionary or you would have to visit the library to read and actual hardbound encyclopedia (Britannia or Americana) and some sucker always had the volume you needed unless you were rich enough to have your own set (few did.)	I don't think the length of it is it's main impediment.  As many have commented here they've tried starting it but never finished, often quitting within the first few hundred pages.  It's more of a pacing issue and the sheer complexity of the start of it with the number of names and such introduced.  It's really not an easy book to get into and will just get more difficult as time goes on and it's harder for people to relate or rely on knowledge of the period for context.	War and Peace is easily one of the best books I've ever read.  It is sad that its length is such an impediment for so many people.  Hope you enjoy it even more the second time!  	I don't know how it's ironic considering the vast majority of readers have no intention or desire to look up items to understand the book they want to read.  Most would expect the book to be a self contained endeavor they should be able to consume.  The issue isn't the ease of finding answers, the issue is having to find answers at all.	0

dsr9a2t	Considered a good Christian family in their neighborhood	from that same article: &gt; Neighbors told ABC News they were shocked to learn the family had as many children in the house as they did, saying they had only recently seen any children outside at all.  sounds like the community really didn’t know these people. turpin’s parents, whom you quote, don’t even live in california, and (again, according to the article you linked to) haven’t seen the family in 4-5 years. not sure how they’re supposed to have their finger on the pulse of that community.  it sounds to me like david turpin was feeding his parents a bunch of BS he thought they wanted to hear. 	http://abcnews.go.com/US/13-siblings-ages-29-held-captive-parents-shackled/story?id=52364267  > The distraught grandparents added that David and Louise Turpin are considered a good Christian family in their community, saying they can't understand any of this.  	this article says nothing about the religious beliefs of these two psychopaths. in fact, your headline is flatly contradicted by a quote from an actual neighbor:  > "[they] were the type that you didn't really get to know anything about them".

dsrmkcb	Considered a good Christian family in their neighborhood	i get that these people identify as christians (not surprising). my point is that the neighborhood they lived in had no idea who they were, or what they were doing. they didn’t consider them to be “good christians”; their neighbors barely considered the turpins at all. from your NPR article:  &gt; However, Kimberly Milligan, 50, who lives across the street, was quoted by the newspaper as saying that when she first moved in she saw a woman outside the house with an infant, but eventually stopped seeing the child. Over the years, Milligan said, she would occasionally see three children who looked like preteens.  &gt;"I thought the kids were home-schooled," she said. "You know something is off, but you don't want to think bad of people."  &gt;Considering the proximity of the houses, Milligan questioned aloud: "How did no one see anything?"	Sorry Christians.

dvcujpn	Gun Rights Activists Are Telling Students To "Shut The Fuck Up"	A popular idea where? In this sub or in society?      As long as the gun is both a religious artifact and a sextoy for American gun owners, nothing will change in society. You can enact these "warm &amp; fuzzy" rules and legislations but it will really do nothing of great impact. The US already have too many guns.      When the dead kids of Sandy Hook changed nothing, I don't think Americans are mentally mature enough to let go of their guns.      I value my right to live more than your right to own a gun!

That being said, I know a ton of religious people wayyyyy smarter than me. So, I just kinda shrug about the whole thing. It baffles me, but people don't believe this stuff one way or the other necessarily because of anything related to their intelligence.

Oblivion has the best story (or the only one that can't be completed in 20 minutes or so), Skyrim has upper hand in everything else.   As much as I love Morrowind, the only thing that I'd like to take from it to Skyrim would be skill requirements for factions (maybe relation interactions between them, when you're a member of CoW you get worse relations with Korir, etc. but that's arguable). Its combat system is utter garbage - and not only because you can miss a direct hit on someone's chest. The whole "3 types of attack thing" and RNGsus watching over your magic. Eww.  Oblivion's world consists of one big ass forest, some snow around Bruma, and that's it. You could delete everything south of Cheydinhal and east of Imperial City and Leyawiin, and it wouldn't make any difference. Same about the Imperial Reserve, there's a lot of areas that look just about the same and nothing ever happens. Not to mention that Leyawiin being just another colonial shithole is a boner killer.	None	Gaenor's easy if you don't insist on a full frontal weapon assault or boom-boom magicks.

Further, tenants have extensive rights; I have heard of a woman who basically squatted at her ex's house after they broke up.

dz7diwt	Women, take back the floor of your open concept office	A lot of people disagree with you.  When colds and flus spread through open offices like an epidemic and people go home at the end of the day with splitting headaches because of the constant noise and interruption, you have problems that are caused not by some employee performance flaw but by idiotic cost-cutting measures and architectural gobbledygook theories.	I have a degree in Architectural Design and currently work for a global commercial relocation company. We specialize in office moving where cost is ALWAYS the biggest factor in a move. Pairing my relocation experience of different styles of offices with education of open vs modular vs static building design, it is extremely cheaper to move and rent/build open floor plan offices.   This doesnt even take into account the benefits of office employee dynamics and teamwork that comes from breaking down barriers. If you need to work privately, its usually due to some sort of performance flaw. I even forgot the biggest reason of them all - aesthetics. Ever been to Google or Apple? Please try to convince them that aesthetics dont matter. 	> When men leer and rank their female colleagues like cuts of meat,  Aside from heterosexual men, guess who else does this?  If you said women you’d be right.  If you said lesbians you’d be right.  If you said gay men you’d be right.  Infact, the person who wrote that garbage had probably done it more than once on the very day the article was written...	While open plan does have benefits, I also agree that it has equal drawbacks, much like you mentioned. But the OC author’s reasoning was just petty and I wanted to highlight a counter argument of plausible reason.   At the end of the day, the issue boils down to that specific office and those that use it. If one person feels creeped out but the other close-nit staff like the camaraderie, that would be different than if the entire staff floor complained of working conditions. If you have everyone complaining about “creepy men” then you don’t have a layout problem, you have a conduct problem and changing up the building space only masks the underlying problem. Sure it may work, but again this is a case by case issue that boils down to decisions made by people much more important to the company.   We also move small time companies where moving costs aren’t “idiotic” issues and they use moving vendors because their staff couldn’t possibly be bothered with staying late and lifting things. Cubicles are simple but not always affordable, then you have to get creative with DIY partitions, orrrrrrrr we just let humans interact with humans. God forbid we talk about how idiotic it is to try to save funds rather than giving every admin member their own suite.   Gobbledygook theories are just that, to uncreative minds. Entire studies have been done over how something simple like lighting can effect productivity. Don’t confuse hooplah with observable impact. 	0
dz7jcx3	Former Playmate w/joint custody of son attempts to keep him in Europe for the entire summer, kills herself and son when judge revokes kid's passport for father's custody rights.	People do extreme things when you try to take their children away.  Loss of child custody is also a leading cause of suicide among men.  The only real difference is that it’s predominantly women who file for divorce.	This is the kind of thing that makes me hate the idea of forced monogamy. Do you think this kind of crazy would just dissapear if she had to stay in a marriage? She would just hide it better until it was too late, and take them all out instead of just herself and her son. I havent read the NYT article and its probably bullshit spin, but forced monogamy is a terrible idea. 	This is terrible.  I was just thinking about the NYT hit piece on Jordan Peterson and how they really lambasted him for his ideas about "forced monogamy".  But you know what?  This woman and her child would still be alive right now if courts didn't hand out divorce like candy at the dentist's office.  At least educate women so that they understand that yeah, kids are not your own private personal property that you are guaranteed to keep after you throw the father to the curb.	I agree.

dzk7c2n	Morgan Freeman. What's wrong with sexually suggestive comments.	Yeah, I don’t disagree with that.  For some of these men, something is hardwired in their brains for them to believe that every woman is fair game.  The majority of men ask themselves if a reasonable person would expect the woman to be interested in them before they approach.  That’s because most of us don’t actually enjoy being humiliated and rejected.  That said, your criteria is light years ahead of the rationalizations goven out by most feminists.  To feminists, it’s all about how a woman feels, regardless of what a reasonable person might interpret as appropriate behavior.  	>They never specify where it is ok to make sexually suggestive comments btw, it seems you can't make them anywhere.  In most circumstances it's this simple: it's okay if it makes it easy or desirable to say yes. It's not okay if it makes it hard to say no.   In this case I think the operative test is: would I be okay if Morgan Freeman said this to my daughter? And would I also be okay if Morgan Freeman said this to my son? If both answers are yes, it passes the test.	None	> Yeah, I don’t disagree with that.

Red Alert was pretty clearly alternate history when the opening cut scene involved Einstein time traveling to kill a younger Hitler.  They didn't call it authentic WW2 and historically accurate, lol.	Doesn't say shit about realism, bf1 is quite believable too, not historically accurate though. I bet around half the world's population wouldn't be able to guess much of what's wrong with bf1.	0

This is what I'm always telling people. Your partner will never improve on their technique if you don't tell them when they are going wrong. A simple "no teeth, babe, you're biting me" will do.	You guys that aren't telling women when they're scraping you are doing everyone a disservice. You may not realize this but we can't feel it when our teeth hit you. If you don't tell us, we'll never know and won't get any better. We have to learn where our teeth are and how to compensate for them.

It would touch the base and head while neglecting the shaft. Tailors tape makes more sense for everyone.	In my experience, for the most accuracy, use tailor's tape to measure girth, and a ruler to measure length. 	No it wouldn’t. A 5 mile road is still 5 miles even if it’s a curved road.	0

How can you not love a book with this opening paragraph?! -  "We were somewhere around Barstow on the edge of the desert when the drugs began to take hold. I remember saying something like "I feel a bit lightheaded; maybe you should drive. ..." And suddenly there was a terrible roar all around us and the sky was full of what looked like huge bats, all swooping and screeching and diving around the car, which was going about 100 miles an hour with the top down to Las Vegas.

Maybe your brain is big enough to realize that even though your brain can be a product of evolution, your legal rights under the law can be a product of justice and human rights.	While that may be the case, it's not *why*.  The reason is because women have evolved to prioritize themselves over men and because men have also evolved to prioritize women over men.  And why is that?  Because of how long it takes to make and raise a child.  And why is that?  Our big ass brains.  Please, if you don't know the answer, refrain from answering :P	Because feminism is simply, by far, the worst case of projection I have ever seen.	None	0

e0j9mjp	Isn't it time for a women only draft?	That’s not a valid rebutal to the argument.  The argument is that the male-only draft was instituted to address a shortfall of male-only volunteers because policy goals called for a male-only quota.  The current policy goals call for a female quota which is not being met because female volunteerism is too low.  It is therefore necessary and appropriate to institute a female-only draft.  That is completely in keeping with the constitution and past Supreme Court rulinrgs, by the way.  So your argument that the last male-only draft happened 45 years ago is totally irrelevant.  That’s the draft for *men*.  We now need a draft for *women*.	> So why not?  because there hasn't been a draft in 45 years.	None	None	0

Either both bathrooms get this treatment or get off your cheap ass and build a 3rd for gender neutral.	None	Which is problematic in and of itself.  But in California (where I live) it's:  (Starting March 1, 2017) all single-user toilet facilities in any business establishment, place of public accommodation or government agency must be identified as “all-gender” toilet facilities. The law authorizes inspectors or other building or local officials responsible for code enforcement to inspect for compliance (Health and Safety Code sec. 118600).  Please note it says "All single-user toilets".  Anything else above and beyond that is at the discretion of the business I believe.  So my original statement stands.  No idea if there's anything on the books where you are saying otherwise.  If someone tells you so I would ask to see the specific ordinance.	0

There is no atheist culture, atheist lifestyle etc... All atheist communities are more or less focused on others. Atheist signs are against Christians etc.  We Christians, do not spend our time on others. Catholic church does not exist to protest Buddhism.

What it WOULD do is sterilize them until they can afford the expensive, difficult, and highly specialized microsurgery procedure necessary to reconnect the tubes. Basically she’s proposing a eugenics program to filter out the poor, even if she doesn’t realize that’s what she’s proposing.	Wouldn't that irreversibly change the way that 15yo boy would develop? In their formative years you are trying to deprive young men of their testosterone which would drastically change the way they developed.   Even if it didn't, it's still insane to even want this for the opposite sex. Her body her choice, also his body her choice.  Edit: I googled vasectomy and testosterone and I read the little Google blurb that pops up.   "These findings suggest thatvasectomymay cause a reduction intestosteronelevels by minimizing the conversion fromtestosteroneto dihydrotestosterone in the long term. Thus, they support the hypothesis that a long-term effect ofvasectomymay be an elevated risk of prostate cancer."

enmeo6i	25 white, Republican, Christian men just voted to ban abortion in Alabama. Where will the good Christians be when those women face thousands of dollars in medical, education & childcare costs? Oh, right, they'll be nowhere to be found... because Christians are only anti-choice, they are not prolife.	I don't know where you got this, you must have misread something. Here, I've cut and pasted the relevant text from my link:  &gt;Views on abortion by gender, 2018  &gt;Men and women express similar views on abortion; 60% of women say it should be legal in all or most cases, as do 57% of men.	That is what your source does NOT show. Men favor making abortion illegal by a margin of 60% to 36% for women. In what world is that " no real difference"?	Super misleading to portray this as women vs. men. There's no real difference between men and women in terms of their views on abortion in the US. These views correlate with level of education and (of course) party affiliation, not gender.

Having been, been engaged to, and having been around militant atheists most of them are just toxic. You breed more cooperativism and understanding by being kind and reasonable like OP. Secularism has been on the rise for decades. Over time more people will be atheists or agnostic.   Personally I feel the end goal for any group of atheists is that no one ever asks or cares about religion. I, personally, hate that I have to use it as an identifier. I *really* don't care about or for religion, but I'm also not against it. To me it just doesn't matter. But to so many other people their religion (or lack thereof) is a core facet of their personality.   Militant Atheists are no different than Militant Christians/Jews/Buddhists/Muslims/whatevers. Sure most atheists aren't going to kill people over their (presumed) lack of beliefs but in my experience that kind of atheist just replaced their previous religion with atheism and nothing else about their proselytizing changed. Just now they profess faith in nothing. Those people are obnoxious. You don't believe in anything? Great. Then what the hell are you shouting about? Leave it alone. Just be a human, stop making religion something that defines you. Let who you are define you.	0

And of course he's right. The New Atheists mostly argue that Christianity's core claims are false, and have a limited audience. While Evangelicals have proven on a national stage that they themselves don't even hold the values they have claimed to hold for decades.

And from the article it's clear the author either doesn't know what a High Councilor is or deliberately is trying to give a false impression. This guy is closer to being the equivalent of a local priest or pastor in other religions than he is to being a "high-ranking church official".	Being on the High Council in the Mormon church is by no means a "high ranking Mormon church official".  The High Council in each stake is 12 or so older guys over usually around 45 and older, chosen out of a possible group of probably 300-400 at most. They rotate out after a few years, and just about everyone serves on it by the time they turn 80.	None	Yeah, I would have to agree with you.

fdgpd66	I just want to kill things and feel good doing it.	No. It's a co-op action/adventure game based around gathering materials from monsters to craft better gear, so you can fight tougher monsters.  I would hardly even call it an RPG, because it lacks several core systems that define RPGs (innate/internal character advancement and an interactive story to name two big ones). Anyone who calls MHW an RPG would, by association, also define Uncharted and The Last of Us as RPGs.  It's still an amazing game!	Is this considered an MMO?	Have you tried Monster Hunter World? Very, very rewarding kills. Gearing is a major grind though.  EDIT: I forgot to add that no, this is not an MMO, but as others have already pointed out, if MHW ticks everything you're looking for, why not?	There's no loot or gear/weapon progression systems in uncharted or the last of us	0
fdp2g43	It’s not that just MMORPGs changed, but the whole internet culture	&gt;I've personally never seen any "hope and optimism" on a wide scale, I've only seen it within small groups.  It's becoming more and more difficult to find those small groups now, because they never organically form within the games, but outside of them. Back in the day, people almost actively looked for social experiences and connections within the game, but not so much any more. That's a huge problem, because it's all been relegated to a few large platforms (Discord, Facebook, Reddit).	Different strokes for different people, I guess, but I began in the days of BBSs, and there were already toxicity and elitism, back then.   With the arrival of Internet more people had access to "the net", and by the time the various IRC clients became widespread, flame-wars ended up being the norm.    When I joined my first MUD in 1991, there were already toxicity, PKilling of "noobs", and rampant elitism of those that had been there longer.   In 2008 when I started playing WoW, "git gud" was already a thing.    I've personally never seen any "hope and optimism" on a wide scale, I've only seen it within small groups.	I dunno if I'd blame internet culture for the decline in online gaming, but it certainly has a hand.   I was in HS when the internet first became a thing.  I remember my computer science class meeting up after school, and it was such a big fucking deal that we got to create EMAIL accounts, don't even get me started when myspace became a thing.  There was such hope and optimism, before it became 'mainstream' and the dogpile buried everything that made it fun and exciting...actually, that does sound a lot like my early MMORPG experiences in Meridian 59, Asheron's Call and Vanilla WoW.  Maybe you're on to something.	None	0
fdp3z8k	It’s not that just MMORPGs changed, but the whole internet culture	The people who're happily playing an MMORPG, have less of a reason to visit this place. :)	You just summed up the entire subreddit in one comment.

fdzudxe	What else can blockchain do for this 3D MMORPG?	I don't know exactly how data mining works, but I assume it's unpacking the files. In which case I'm not sure if blockchain tech will be of use there, but who knows. I was just interested if the tech could be used to prevent people from accessing files, to data mine them.	>Would blockchain technology make it harder to datamine the game?  Do you mean [unpack game](https://www.reddit.com/r/SWGalaxyOfHeroes/comments/4cb0rp/datamining/d1h0o17?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) files to explore what the code reveals by datamining, or maybe you mean gameplay data analysis from a big data leak or hack...?  This is a really interesting question and I'll ask one of the developers involved in this blockchain integration for a response if you can give me a link to the kind of activity you'd want to prevent.	Aside from the microtransaction problem.  Would blockchain technology make it harder to datamine the game? If so, it could be something worth looking into if devs are interested in preserving the mystery of MMORPGs.     I don't know enough about the technology to be able to answer the question, so I'll put it up here and see if someone can answer it.	"You could in theory make it more inconvenient by putting data on the blockchain that the client would then stream when needed, so it's not all in a large file installed on the desktop machine to simply decompress and get all at once. i feel the idea of blockchain is to be more transparent though."  \^ For interest - this was the response from Nicemans - the dev involved in integrating HPB with The Tale of Toast.	0
fea3b9o	Two States. Eight Textbooks. Two American Stories.	The changes were hardly earth shattering. What a tempest in a teapot.	Well partly because neither book is wrong. It's just a matter of what they choose to exclude and the narrative that they create with what they include.  Any history book is going to have opinion and analysis. And every primary source is probably going to be heavily biased because they were part of whatever conflict or movement they are quoted talking about.  It's the same deal as with the whole "fake news" thing that everyone accuses everyone else of.  It's not usually straight up fake news. It's just that you can create quite a narrative by excluding parts of the story or only hearing the arguments and opinions from one side of a conflict.	Why hasnt this become bigger? I mean historical revisionism in textbooks in other countries become world wide news and there's talk about censorship, brainwashing, political party control and authoritarian rule. But here its like... "I also experienced this in school. Oh well watchu gonna do."	You're getting downvoted but seriously. The Texas one doesn't have a footnote about SCOTUS allowing some gun laws, and the California one doesn't have a sentence about literary critiques of the Harlem Renaissance. How will we survive?  First of all, never get all your history from a single source. I hate textbooks for this reason. Second of all, the two big deals mentioned at the beginning of the articles are things that any normal high schooler should find obvious. No artistic movement is without critique, and the Bill of Rights is interpreted through many SCOTUS opinions. I wouldn't be offended by my child reading either "version." The variation from teacher to teacher is far more likely to impact the students, anyway.	0
fepej3y	Trump creates the "Right to Pray" guidance in school. Disgusting.	Yeah, I read the article and I don't see letting people hide information is a free speech issue. "Compelling speech" means making people express a viewpoint they don't hold. Letting religions present themselves as the only alternative is allowing them to coerce people into accepting religious services. Free speech 100% does not encompass that.	You can always tell the people who only read the title of a post versus the linked article lol.  The big change had nothing to do with right to pray in schools which was always allowed. The big change is that religous organizations no longer have the government compelling speech to name non secular alternatives as they did under the Obama era rule.  I'm not religious but I'm definitely against the government compelling speech. For me, this is a positive thing.	*insert 'that was always allowed', Rick and Morty meme*	None	0

fj4ruow	a medical term is a slur now	I’m probably slow, but can you explain the joke please?	This reminds me of a joke a classmate dropped in a seminar when our prof asked if there was such a thing as a feminist empiricism.  My classmate said, dryly, "Lesbian folk song is *not* a valid empirical method." We (the only two lesbians in the class but, by far, the two biggest shitlords in the class) died laughing; the prof had to wait for us to compose ourselves.	All words are s*urs because writing and language is inherently colonial.... in fact, people shouldn’t talk. Only interpretive dance is a valid form of communication.	Lesbian folk song is a cultural thing; no one would ever call it a valid scientific method.	0
fkd1ec1	All mormons have to believe in Aliens	It doesn't actually say in the Bible that no other planets with life forms were created, though. Unless you count the fact that it implies the sky is a solid dome and the Earth is flat, but almost all religions seem to pretend those parts don't exist.	In the beginning, the bible starts; then list 7 stages of life. Every other religion has a beginning except the mormons.	If you believe in God and don't believe in aliens, then you probably believe that God made billions of planets and then didn't use them for anything. Talk about weird.	None	0
fl8bngs	TIL a New Jersey man bought a $5 bottle of orange juice from Shoprite; his wife said it was too expensive and sent him back to return it, because it was on sale for $2.50 elsewhere.

Id never have won:  1. wasting the time over $2.50? uhh k 2. then wasting the $2.50 on lottery?   sorry i just dont support systems that exploit morons	None	Meh.

I mean, that makes sense since the whole of Japan is considerably larger than Las Vegas and Macau. Maybe a different parameter would be better for comparing.	None	And Japan is.

g0hrx3s	Life's too short to read books you're not enjoying	You can and should push yourself if it's a "classic but even then if it's not your cup of tea? Why suffer? Reading should be pleasurable. Even dense technical material shouldn't be such a slog. Thats why we pick books up and frequently put them down. The idea you have to torture yourself is absurd.	I agree with this, no one should force themselves to finish reading a book. Only exception is if the book is highly recommended, a "classic," or famous. Then I would read to the end to make sure I didn't miss anything	None	I'm not saying anyone should torture themselves reading a book...  Example: When reading Twilight I was bored and didnt care too much but since it was so popular at the time I finished it to make sure I got the full context of the hype at the time	0
g6aqfzf	TIL that the highest posted speed limit in the United States is 85 MPH. It applies to exactly one 41-mile stretch of highway in Texas.	Once covid is over I shall travel to see one of those signs.	\*laughs in German\*  When I have friends from overseas visiting me here in Berlin, I always take them out of town to one of the lakes. On the way, I love to scare them a bit. I drive onto a stretch of the Autobahn that starts within the city and therefore has a speed limit of 60km/h or about 37mph. From there it takes a minute or two to reach a point with [these signs](https://i.imgur.com/KNxF9VE.jpg), which mean that all speed restrictions are lifted. The Autobahn itself looks exactly the same as before and few people from abroad recognize the sign, so as soon as I pass that sign, I floor the pedal and don't let go until I'm at 200km/h or about 125mph. People always freak out and are convinced that it somehow has to be illegal, but it's not and it's really fun to see the shock turn into a wide (sightly maniacal) smile.	There's nothing like going 90 without any fear of being pulled over.  Fairly straight road and kind of fun to drive.	None	0

gd5sz31	TIL Sloths lose 1/3 of their body weight when they poop, which happens once a week on the ground, and in the standing position.	Is this why I poop on a toilet? is there some weird bacterial symbiosis going on???	That's what folks who study sloths were wondering for years. The latest theory is that they crawl to poop on the forest floor as part of a larger ecosystem. Inside sloth fur is a species of moth. These moths fly out when sloths poop and lay their eggs in the poop. The eggs hatch, eat the poop, and fly out to land and live on another sloth. In exchange, the moths exchange a lot of nitrogen, which aids in the growth of a species of algae which *also* lives on sloth fur. The sloth eats the algae to add to its diet which consists mostly of leaves. So it's this sloth -> moth -> algae lifecycle that benefits all three species.	You're literally hanging from a tree! Just poop! Your chances of dying would be drastically lower.	You don’t keep your fur moths?	0

Its true; the devoted poet should stand erect in his values, but not necessarily in his little poems, which are truly witty and charming when they're a little soft, and not too stiff, but can still cause a little tingling-- I don't just mean for youth, but for hairy men who can't make their own loins stand upright!

gj2ynkm	Is death a fact?	Even if that's true does that only apply if you're a billionaire now or just mean people need to literally or metaphorically "start saving"	I often pull this argument down to economy.   Even if there is a crazy new tech invented, what is certain is that 1. it will be billionaire level expensive, and 2. it will be only for very few.   So even if this happens, if you are not a billionaire, it will not apply to you.	None	there are therapies, even today, that will enable you to slow down the ageing.  most of them are very expensive.  so if you start early "preserving" it would be much better.  so that means you better be a billionaire now.  if you become one later that will help greatly also.  also you cannot save your way to a billion, thats not how it works.	0

gjkn13g	The U.S. Is Retreating from Religion - By 2030, say projections, a third of Americans will have no religious preference	Or would that just create either essentially a theocracy but with the religion stuff find-replaced for science stuff or something as hyper-rational as the kind of casual Star Trek fans who also think TOS Kirk is a womanizer and that the line "Beam me up, Scotty" was used verbatim think Vulcan is like	Let's hope faith in science can fill the void... Fingers crossed !	The main problem with people in this thread is that everyone seems to think that when your remove religion to people they stop being religious. That it'll create a rational utopia. People will always be religious and if it isn't a God it's the state or a shallow pleasure or an ideology.  It's a part of human nature.	None	0

You don't have to be a food snob to really dislike McDonald's food.  They might just have different taste buds than you - for example, [supertasters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supertaster).  If you call everyone with different tastes than you a food snob, you're being as bad as an actual food snob.	I know it's cool to hate on mcdonalds, but the food doesn't taste that bad, is fast, and is inexpensive. it's not somewhere to eat every day, but if it's late, and it's open, no need to be a food snob.	couldn't you have insisted on taking him somewhere that didn't suck?	No, I'm calling someone who say's "Couldn't you have insisted on taking him somewhere that didn't suck" a food snob considering it was 10PM out at night.  the difference between saying "I'm not a big fan of mcdonalds, can we go somewhere else," and "Mcdonalds sucks, let's go someone else," is that the former assumes that everyone has different taste buds, and some people don't mind it, even if they do, the later has the arrogance of assuming everyone shares the same tastes, if not an entire value system (since mcdonalds generally does have a stigma of being cheap food), that they do.	0

I can't tell but I think you might have been trying to be funny...	It's also a bit odd when the r/scotland angry mob refer to 'The English' as if they're a monolithic, homogeneous entity.  Damn those bankers in Lincolnshire.  Damn those Cornish elites holding Scotland back.	The English hate all politicians. Cameron, Clegg and Miliband are hardly loved are they? This us vs them rhetoric is tiresome and /r/Scotland is far too sensitive to what 'the English' think of their politicians. 	I'm agreeing with the comment.  r/Scotland is obsessed with the 'English' view of politicians.  But what's even more silly is that the comment is right - these views are all lumped in as 'The English' thinking this, or 'The English' thinking that.   As if Yorkshire, London, Cornwall, Liverpool are pretty much all the same.  Just Elitist bankers hating on Scots right?	0

criqmtd	Someone was looking for a Dust Mod play through, here's my first episode!	I appreciate your response, but I'm still wondering if it's just a survival mod or if it plays like NV, with quests, NPCs to interact with, etc.	It's set in an alternate future, 20 years after the events of New Vegas.  The Courier fulfilled the alternate ending to Dead Money and brought the Cloud to New Vegas. The weather of the Divide has somehow spread to the Mojave, and with it, the tunnelers. Chaos has taken over as civilization has broken apart - the Legion is no more - absolutely dissolved into various tribal groups, though the NCR has managed to keep several strongholds in the Mojave, and they are unaffected in the Core region outside of the Mojave. You are a survivor of the aftermath, looking to find a way out of the Mojave. As you explore, you can find notes and terminal entries that help explain the current state of the Mojave, and might also help you find an escape from the Mojave. 	Does Dust have quests and a story, or is it just Day Z in the Fallout universe?  IE is it just wandering around, scrounging for resources, killing people while trying to avoid getting killed?	The one objective is to escape the Mojave, so it's like the only quest. Everything else you do is optional, but you can learn the story to DUST by reading notes and terminal entries.   It plays like a survival mod, but like the mod page says, it's heavily story-based through notes and terminal entries. There are few NPCs to interact with - friendly survivors and traders.   You can actually get the Legend of the Star quest, but I have yet to get 50 star caps to proceed further. Maybe the quest will actually work, and the mod author didn't touch Pew Pew. But it's really the only quest I've found so far.	0

cvilobl	Could the Wink hub get a software update that would reduce the latency between pushing a button and having a light turned on, or is that a hardware limitation?	I have STv2 (and had v1) and have always found the performance to be acceptable.  I bought a Wink, and stopped using it within a few days ... thought it was junk, but I realize that it's worked out for some folks ... so to each his own.  However, please keep in mind that right now a *large* majority of SmartThings SmartApps ... are still actually cloud-driven.  There is support for local execution, but very few SmartApps which can do that at this point in time.  There is a lot of grumbling on the SmartThings community forums about that at the moment.  There's also a way to log into the web-based control/debug panel and see which SmartApps you have locally, and which are still executing on their servers.	I hate the cloud stuff. I don't know how these hub makers could think that that was a good idea. 	That's the difference between cloud controllers and local controllers... cloud adds latency not present with local controllers... 	None	0

cyxtyne	The Stupid Party Gets Stupider	That's fine and good, but the media is unforgiving.  Rubio needed an sip of water and was ridiculed, Jindal was made fun of because he tried reacting in real time.  	Think about what he was likely to say - craft a speech in response to that, take notes during the speech and adjust as needed.  Eating dinner before the speech, I was able to come up with a list of what he was going to talk about, and his positions on those things, without even trying.

d1ftai6	Thoughts and Feedback on a few songs	I'm with you. I believe this platform is an incredibly valuable resource which is sadly underutilized. I only regret that being neither musician nor songwriter, my critical contributions are probably not worth much.	No I agree actually, I've only started using reddit in general so definitely intend to participate both ways! Thanks for the feedback and for taking the time to listen. 	IANAM; IANASW. Whatever I have to say is probably not worth two cents.  I listened to both tracks once each. I found the first one more appealing (channel Dylan often, do you?); the second was a bit slow and long for my taste, although I'm sure you have your reasons for crafting it that way.  On the point of feedback, I've noticed that most folks who post music here for comment never contribute commentary on anyone else's work. I'm not deluded in thinking my remarks are going to change the character of the sub or prompt anyone to change their ways. Still, I can't help but think such folks are being horribly selfish.	None	0
d1glapj	Wrote some lyrics and wanna know if it's in the right direction. Constructive critique appreciated!	It's an almost universal problem, I think. You're trying to express feelings that are deeply personal, so it's quite natural that language will probably fall short of perfect communication. There's also a high risk of sounding cliché, especially since this might be the most popular topic in music history and it's been done to death already.	I've got a couple rhythms/melodies in mind I think might work, it is an irregular format. Thanks about the lyrics though, I thought they could use some clearing up but just needed to be sure.

d1xskr6	My OS (Windows 7) is installed on a HDD. I just got an SSD. I'm keeping the OS installed on the HDD and not installing it on the SSD. How can I use the SSD to make my OS faster?	HDD has nearly 1,000GB on it.  SSD is 256GB.    Sorry, forgot to add that.	Clone the HDD to the SSD. Bam! No reinstall. 	None	So install Windows on the ssd, and install all the apps you care about for speed (which with a 250 gb is probably most if not all your apps) on it as well.

d7vgbgu	[Standard] UWb Draw-Go	You can draw as many cards as you want. It wont help if you cant win. Your only two win cons are flashhulk (which they can kill with removal) and dovin ban ult (Which cant win you the game by itself, again you need a different threat). How long do you think it's going to take you to close out the game. Expect an average of 25 minutes per game. How are you going to punish the GW Hulk deck if they just play slower?  You need somekind of finisher, whether it's Sorin or Avacyn.   If you don't believe me about rebuff, go play a mirror match against another control player not playing them. Count how many just wind up in your hand cause the games gone on so long they always have the two mana to spend.	Flash threats like Gearhulk and CA from glimmer are the primary punishes I have atm. Do you think more flash creatures such as Avacyn could help that issue? Feels like they would just be removal magnets.	As soon as I realize you are playing revolutionary rebuff, I'm just going to wait till i have the extra two mana, and what are you going to do about it? Literally nothing. I had the same problem when deck building where I was being too reactionary. The problem is that the current standard format really requires some pro active threats. No one will have a problem waiting until your rebuffs and shrivels are dead cards. Sure they are decent against people trying to play on curve, but like I said before, you have no way of punishing if they just play patiently.  Edit: Keep bringing the downvotes. Doesn't matter to me. Doesn't make the card better.	Agree with this. I've been playtesting a similar Esper list on XMage and the big issue has always been closing out games. Gearhulks just aren't enough against decks with removal.	0
d7vgi0y	[Standard] UWb Draw-Go	Look at his list. Why would I be scared of the game going late? He literally has 3 cards in his whole deck to threaten my life total.  (not including shambling vents since he hast to tap a good portion of his mana to use them) Tell me how this beats the GW Hulk token deck?	is that really a win for you though? If you play that game you better hope you have the later wincon	As soon as I realize you are playing revolutionary rebuff, I'm just going to wait till i have the extra two mana, and what are you going to do about it?

d94ti4k	Are you on any Antipsychotics/Mood Stabilizers/Antidepressants and have they affected your weight?	Choking is a great descriptor for how it feels.. lol.  You are lucky!	I take it along with dinner because fortunately it doesn't make me tired. But the days when I forget to take it with dinner and have to choke down another 350 calories are not my favorite.	I instantly gained about 5lbs on Latuda, but I think that may be because I have to eat the 350 calories with it last thing at night. I seem to be holding steady other than that initial bump.. still sucks!  Also, I can't lose weight to save my life. That may just be a normal thing for me, though. I'm about 205 and 6', so I'm not too overweight.	None	0

db7hvvs	Max Landis claims poppy is just a rip off of mars argo	It also seems a bit like part of the commentary.

But it does seem how it can be a bit fucked up how he left mars argo and then did the exact same thing with another girl	I feel like I could already see that Titanic needed a new voice and face to continue his project because he refused to let his gold mine go along with the person he developed it with.

ddd43ud	Previous tenant (DC) just realized he's been paying a utility bill for two years. What's the next step?	Correct, he was paying them directly. Apparently he never checked for two years, though. I need to get the real total amount he's paid before I can really talk to the current tenant, I think..	Do you pay the utilities and the tenants reimburse? Why didn't he call and cancel his service and the new tenant call and setup his service.   If he was paying for services he wasn't using you should reimburse him and set something up with the current tenant to pay off the balance with you. 	None	If he called power company and setup service originally and called to cancel service at end of lease it's on the power company for not calling it. You're OP made it sound like you personally were involved somehow in the tenant setting up service. If you're doing it that way I'd stop unless some local regulation requires you to be involved. For my properties, utilities are between the tenant and the provider. I only care they have them, not who it is or anything else. Plus not checking for two years sounds really dumb.   If you have nothing to do with his service at all then tell new tenant to get his service setup asap but old tenant needs to take it up with the provider. 	0

For reference: started with getting my only strong DPS with 2B a couple days ago. Then just now, I got stoned and bored and decided to finally go in on the mythril bundle after bombing on the copper chest and gold bundles. Used the 4 star ticket, got..

I fucking got a back to back rainbow. Tap... 2B!! Holy shit I have the craziest damage potential now, idk wtf to even do.

do6myq5	Need suggestions or advice on buying a new drum set. Been playing a little over a year, a few small shows.	Thanks! I will have to find a local music shop that lets me test out different sets. My guitar center didn't have any acoustic sets to test out unfortunately.	So, it really depends on how you want to sound and how you want to set up your kit. Personally I started on a cappy thrift store set, played a Pearl export maple for almost a decade and then got a Pearl Masters birch. I would suggest playing everything you can to find the right sound for the music you cover. Then, you probably want to look at something with Toms that don't mount into the bass drum. Beyond that, it's up to you.  For cymbals, I'd say go get a decent Zildjian pack, especially at the starting out in a cover band stage of your playing.  I'm not anexpert, just been playing a while and on my 3rd set.  I hope this helps.  Remember, it's up to you. So, get something you like and will be happy with.	None	Well, then you need to find a new Guitar Center lol. You may want to try a  Sam Ash. There are also YouTube videos demoing different kits (if the sound is actually any good).

A lot of people claim that famous shot of a soldier being hit by a bullet is faked. 	It's not just wildlife photography. I see this in many genres with often a reluctance (or intentional) failure to disclose on the part of the photographer.	Not sure what you're talking about but there's a photo by Capa that shows a soldier as he was shot. It's considered by some to be faked and is arguably one of the guy's most famous photos. 	0

From a practical standpoint, no gun legislation will ever pass congress unless the Democrats get a veto proof majority in the senate (60 seats) plus majority of the House.

Kind of a thumb-sucker article that I don't think gets to the heart of the question.  Assets and firepower aside, we lost because we tried to fight WW2 in a guerilla war.  We failed to engage meaningfully with the S. Vietnamese civilians - I blame a systemic racism I personally witnessed when I was there - and we thought by just killing enough VC, we would win.  We ignored the lessons of the past on assymetrical warfare (Ord Wingate, for example) and thought our methods were superior. The political/home front didn't factor into the calculations until it was too late, but the North Vietnamese knew better.  American families got sick of casualty lists and didn't see any clear-cut progress on the maps.  Eventually we just got tired of fighting and went home.  We ceded the battlefield to the enemy.

Some nights that might be fine, other nights it might not be enough and I keep having to semi wake up to hit the button again, delaying my sleep a little bit more.

We got the new make spirit, 12y doublewood, 15y single cask, 17y doublewood, 21 portwood, 30 year old, a 36 year old from 1983 pulled straight out of the cask at the warehouse and finally the 14y peat week.  Such an awesome tour and tasting.	I completely agree, it's an excellent tour.  Extra tip: try to visit outside the busiest period. When the tour groups are smaller, they often bring out some more exclusive whiskies during the tasting. We were offered one of the DCS Compendium single malts, which is one of the most amazing whiskies I've ever tasted.	None	None	0
f5h66dl	AP: Florida moves up to #6 with decisive win over the bye week	It's impossible for LSU to be 12-1 while Bama is 13-0... also there is no scenario where 2 of UF LSU Bama and Georgia have a claim to the playoffs if OU Clem and OSU are all 12-1/13-0	Interesting thought. 13-0 Alabama, 13-0 Ohio State, 12-1 LSU, 12-1 Oklahoma, 13-0 Clemson. Who gets left out? Based on wins and SOS I could see #1 Alabama, #2 Ohio State, #3 LSU, #4 Clemson. Or even 12-1 UF 12-1 LSU I feel like the story stands.	None	12-1 UF va 12-1 Alabama who lost in the SEC champ game. Does Oklahoma get the nod with their strength of schedule or lack of good wins? I don’t think so. Also yea I meant 11-1 Alabama or 11-1 LSU depending on who loses.	0
f5u42jw	Best summoner build for fast Maps?	Solar Guards from Act 8 + spell echo + GMP + fire pen	Literally any summoner build will let you clear maps fast. Slave driver spectres with zombies as meatshields worked really well for me. There are other really strong spectres as well, such as flame sentinels (that's the name I think?) So you could look up whichever Spectre's AI and type suits you best  If you want something different from necromancers, you could look into guardian summoners or even gladiator summoners.	None	None	0
f8q37ys	How The Mandalorian ties into the latest trilogy.	He’s also the immediate and direct descendant of the person that was prophesied to wipe out basically an entire side of the force. Which is important, because Luke actually brings up lineage when he’s trying to figure out who Rey is in the last movie.   Rey needs a better explanation than “because Luke and Ani”. I do think that the explanation of her skills will be what links her to the royal family.	Luke was skilled with zero training too. He held his own against Vader after training with yoda for like 2 days, and Vader was one of the most powerful jedis of his time, arguably way more powerful than Kylo Ren. I think the Rey plot hole is more about how she is connected to the Skywalker saga than about her skills with the force. There needs to be an explanation of Rey's origins as a whole. Being injected with midichlorians would be kind of a sellout in my opinion. Midichlorians are dumb.	None	None	0

f8qm3yl	[New Interest] [help] Hey I always liked sculptures but ppl thought i was weird for it. I was going through college campus and this poster caught my eye. What does it represent? Beauty or strength? Whats the ideology behind it? Can i get the name by chance? I think its a painting. Thank you	Get a block of [super sculpty](https://www.amazon.com/Polyform-Super-Sculpey-Firm-Oven/dp/B001C4RTP2/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=super+sculpt+firm&amp;qid=1574719693&amp;sr=8-2) and make anything you are crazy for liking. You may surprise yourself.	I really appreciate that because I thought I was crazy for liking it so much. I'll probably drop by the art class to see more sculpture art and ask more about it. Eye of the beholder indeed, I LOVE it. I saw some others but i liked this ome this most.  I'm gonna try and look deeper into this subject. Thank you!	Looks like charcoal on news print. I did a reverse image search and could't come up with anything. It could be student work.  As far as what it represents, you will have to find the artist and ask them. It may be a value study, or it may have deep symbolism and meaning. Whatever you come up with is fine. Eye of the beholder and all!	None	0
f9kfbxt	What's your experience with prioritization?	People also tend to use lack of prioritization as a means of procrastinating the tasks that they truly need to complete. We like to satisfy ourselves with a few good check-offs, even if we're checking off unimportant tasks.	>Priority is more important than many GTDers seem to think.  That's my thinking also. The author of GTD assumes that people prioritize well intuitively, but in reality it's very often not the case.	>The most recent problem I described in my previous post is that I didn't allocated enough time to empty my GTD inbox and do weekly GTD reviews.  This commonly leads to falling off the GTD wagon. Be careful.  It's very easy to "find" more next actions to do, and to do them perfectly! This often prevents you from doing what's important. Priority is more important than many GTDers seem to think.	None	0

fb4mtss	Newbie here. Don't really feel like reading guides so does anyone have any tips for me?	Archmage has to be one of the tankiest classes in the game.       Go for HP+ items, and choose electricity, fire, or arcane to focus on. You don't need heavy armor like most people say--- though I have only really played on Normal. The rest of your skills can go towards displacement shield, Aegis tree, metamagic (for dispel level 3 and whatever else you fancy from that tree), and your advanced element tree.       Iirc, once you do enough damage with the respective element, you unlock the advanced magic tree for said element.       It's popular to invest in multiple damage types, but I feel like this is a trap that really limits AM's damage mid to late game unless you roll well on your unique items (Archmage robes, Elemental Fury, &amp; Spellblade are the items that come to mind)	I unlocked archmage today but haven't had the chance to try it yet.	Find an arcane item for the apprentice by the maze. The class you unlock from this quest provides a playstyle that might suit you better.	I generally just put enough points in all 3 damage trees to get all 3 as beams, plus the shielding of arcane (assuming I’m not arcane already), plus the floaty thing from lightning (I forget what it’s called but I like it).	0

fbhob2w	PC/Switch Looking for Action/Adventure Game That...	What is Ori like? I'm on a bit of a gaming funk? I wanna know cause I've heard that name.	Have you played Yooka Laylee? Reviews arent excellent but it should be of the same style.  Also, Ori and the Blind Forest has an extremely colorful style.	None	It’s a 2D game, with an art style so detailed and animated it can be hard to discern 2D vs 3D. It’s an exploration platformer where you steadily gain new abilities and can do various acrobatics like leaping off of enemies and projectiles.  The genre of 2D platformers based around exploring with a map is often called “Metroidvania”; not quite the same as old 3D collectathon platformers like Banjo Kazooie, but sort of close.	0
fbhw5xj	PC/Switch Looking for Action/Adventure Game That...	The first two actually are my least fav type of games. Reason being I like games that last.   Transistor sounds ok I guess. Not really my thing, but thanks.	Katana Zero.   Celeste.    Both games are short and sweet, but there was never a dull moment in either.   Katana Zero has an 80's neon aesthetic and is a story about escaping a life of crime and drug addiction, with the help of a surrogate daughter figure. Celeste is about a depressed girl who learns to believe in herself by climbing a mountain, including stages based on the four seasons.  Another game you might like is Transistor, which is currently $4 on Switch.  It's a dystopian cyberpunk story with lots of neon lights and flashy streetscapes.  I'm personally not a big fan of the narrative style, but the moveset options and combat customization are superb.	None	None	0

femwo7k	What to keep?	Because some people don't want to restart every time they make a new build. It can be a lot easier to just reset skill points and hop over to another build if you are already at the ultra late game where you have the items easily.	Why keep anything you aren't using? If it doesn't work for your build there's no reason to keep it.   Or are you like, trying to give yourself some leeway to try out completely different builds if you feel like it or something? Personally I just start a new file if I want to do that.	None	Sure, but that means you are going to use it, so that isn't really against what I said. In the TCs case, it doesn't seem like they were actually going to use most of it, hence them actually cleaning a bunch of stuff out.	0

fgz0hxk	Closer to Russian style propaganda CNN has never been. WTF is going on!	I find it troubling when I see people citing nothing more than anecdotal experiences with people they've interacted with online and generalizing it to the larger base of supporters - it's a basic logical thinking error, no? Is there anything scientific we can point to to say that one candidates supporters are more toxic than another's? I haven't seen that yet. Besides, how many times have we been told that Russian trolls are out there making fake accounts, memes, and setting up fake pages to sow discord (example: there are fake Russian pages impersonating BLM). We know that this is part of their plan and I think moderates and more leftist Democratic voters should be keeping this in mind when they see divisive people online.	I mean they aren't wrong. A portion of his base still can't get over 2016 despite his frontrunner status. Because of this, they spit venom at any one challenging their savior Sanders.  It's a very troubling cult of personality similar to that which surrounds Trump.  I say this as someone who will probably vote for Sanders as Warren is slipping in viability in Texas.	None	None	0

The Doctor awkwardly heading towards the console like that is clearly a comedic moment.  The Doctor's previous issues with empathy usually amount to him not noticing things or being caught up in something else. This was told plainly to her face in a quiet moment where she had nothing else to worry about.  Rewatch the episode. Her final speech to the eternals. She literally says every time.	1.  The Doctor never claimed that humans always prevail over depression.   2. This is not the first time the Doctor has had a problem with empathy.   3.  How was Graham's story played for laughs? I think you are reading into it something that isn't there.	None	0
fi4wmt8	If we can't use the spin of an entangled particle to transfer information, can we use the information of it changing at all or not?	The very first measurement will break the entanglement regardless of which basis you choose. From that point on there are just two uncorrelated qubits.	I don't understand this.  What if, when I want to send a 0 I measure in the computational basis 1000 times in a row and when I want to send a 1 I measure in the X basis 1000 times in a row.  My partner could then measure the qbit 500 times in a row in the computational basis and then another 500 in the X basis. For one of the two basis they'll get 500 measurements in a row with the same value (cause because we're both measuring in the same basis we won't change the state once or collapses in the first run) and for the other measurement they'll get 50% of the time one measurement and 50% of the times the other measurement (cause we are interlacing measurements in orthogonal basis).  What am I missing?	> The other entangled particle is in another machine that constantly observes its spin for any changes.  There is no change to observe. Measuring the spin of one particle does not affect the spin of the other. Or, more precisely, there is no measurable difference to the spin.	None	0
fj0ab1v	Does quantum decoherence just mean qubits losing its superposition and collapsing? If so, then how is it possible to happen when observer can observe the qubits at any axis they want?	Without getting too deep into interpretations of quantum mechanics, decoherence can explain why the state *appears* to have collapsed after a measurement. The reality is that the state becomes entangled with the environment and that loss of information is experimentally equivalent to a wave function collapse. Whether you want to entirely remove the wave function collapse from quantum mechanics is an ontological discussion that's probably not appropriate for this sub.	So decoherence doesnt necessarily mean collapsing but rather just losing informations or getting mixed with noise?	Decoherence is a result of the quantum system interacting and entangling with the environment, which by definition is outside of our control and is hence a loss of information.  This can happen by an intentional measurement or accidental noise. It's true you can define a measurement such that decoherence doesn't occur, however we generally don't know enough about the state to do that. Also, this gets exponentially more complicated with entangled states.   Accidental noise is obviously random and the way to preserve information is quantum error correction.	None	0

If anyone who claims progressive doesn’t show up in November, then you are a FRAUD.  The End.	Biden did not try to bring progressives into the fold tonight. He lied about his past record and gave no solutions to what progressives care about. Bernie did not help himself either tonight. He needed to come at Biden way harder than he did. Biden gave one word answers, waited for Bernie to answer and then parroted what Bernie said. The whole Cuba, China bullshit was aggravating just for the fact that it shows that people refuse to think beyond a black and white mentality. It was just fuel for people who respond to dog whistling.   One last thing. The whole "how will you deal with the Coronavirus?" question is pretty pointless when you CANT do anything now at this moment if you ARE NOT the current president. It was a pointless question and won't be a concern once either candidate gain the office.	None	So anyone who has a negative opinion of Biden is somehow a bro? Way to "unify" the party bro.	0

fmnpzir	Coronavirus Discussion Thread	It's also because that language (optimism) is being co-opted by deniers. There's a middle ground here between remaining optimistic about the outcome (which we all should be doing) and being gleefully ignorant of the reality. And the latter often gets confused for the former.  That said, I really like that you're trying to spread positivity here. We all need it, especially those of us on this sub. Keep it up!	I've asked before and I will ask again:  Why is it that, with most other crises, there are often very vocal, steady people who will advocate for things to be better, and positivity is encouraged? But with COVID, daring to even *hint* at the possibly that things will get better (and relatively soon) gets you screamed at for downplaying the illness, encouraging people to break social distancing, and claiming you're full of shit?   And I'm not just talking about *that* sub. I've been part of a handful of wonderful, educated, female-dominated spaces on Reddit for years now. But even those subreddits, while normally sane and pleasant, are full of doomers. But it seems like this is the only place not full of doomers. So now I think that I am delusional and living in an echo chamber because it feels like everyone everywhere is so damn negative.	None	None	0
fn21awy	Why do people consider Dark Souls games to have good combat, when it's literally just a mash-spam combination of roll-dodge-attack?	&gt;It's because that combination of roll-dodge-attack facilitates a far more deep combat system that allows for many different combat styles  How so? Most RPGs, including the Witcher, have a roll-dodge-attack combat system. Yet TW3 gets slandered for its combat system, while Dark Souls gets praised	It's because that combination of roll-dodge-attack facilitates a far more deep combat system that allows for many different combat styles. When you combine that with the rpg progression system and the wide range of weapons you have a virtually infinite combinations for combat.	None	First of all, I think the TW3 has a very good combat system. That's beside the point though.  I think the main difference is in Dark Souls you always know what your character will do given certain inputs however in the Witcher Geralt will occasionally add flourishes to his attacks giving them different timing.  Another difference is enemy attacks Dark Souls enemys have very clear attacks with punishing damage and the encouter design itself is amazing and naturally teaches you about the nature of the game. In the Undead Burg in DS1 every encounter is making a point about what you will see in the game.   I think the overarching idea is that it's a very well tuned system that allows for depth in a difficult game without being punishing.	0

fpjt2xw	Weekly /r/Breadit Questions thread April 29, 2020	Thanks, I’ll try that. I usually incorporate the fats at the very beginning.	You may want to develop the gluten further so it would be more stretchy. Extra fat, salt, and sugar inhibit gluten development so I'd recommend doing autolyse without those ingredients and really developing gluten as intensely as possible, then incorporating the fat, salt, and sugar.	I just made sweet dough using a sourdough starter. I have encountered this problem twice already while doing sweet/enriched dough. The dough just doesn’t seem to be passing the “poke test”. When I poke it, it leaves an indentation and it barely bounces back. If you don’t touch it, it looks like it has the texture of playdoh. I can clearly see fingerprints on it. When I touch it though, it seems like a good dough. It’s tacky, stretchy, and it doesn’t stick on the sides of the pan. I kneaded for about 10-12 minutes.   My question is, is this dough good enough as long as it rises? Are these just the qualities of enriched dough and am I overthinking it?  I used all purpose flour, 1 egg, milk with around 6% fat, and commercial butter.	None	0

fqnrijz	BOOM! Studios reveals "Power Rangers: Drakkon New Dawn" miniseries by Burch/Ragazzoni	I’m with you on this. I’m tired of Drakkon, and of Boom’s take on PR in general. You can tell the stories are written by people who weren’t initially huge fans of the show to begin with and don’t understand the appeal of the franchise. They shoehorn in generic original characters that look like bad X-Men fanart, applaud themselves for eye-rolling gimmicks, and come up with suit/zord designs that Toei wouldn’t touch with a ten-foot brachio staff. Yes, they’ve helped build visibility and credibility with the adult fanbase, but Boom has a couple of dead horses they enjoy beating for profit and Drakkon is one of them.  Also, the way Tommy is drawn as the White Ranger looks comical in most of the panel art these days. Why is that? And don’t get me started on how little focus Rocky, Adam, and Aisha are being given.	I've gotta say man - I'm so freaking over Drakkon at this point...  Like the idea of "Evil Tommy" wasn't even all that unique or new in the first place, since it's literally how his story started BUT OKAY... they pushed it to extremes they couldn't get away with in a Children's Show... so that's kinda neat...  Then they just milked him for 3 years and 14 different forms, and multiple releases, and every type of merchandise known to man, and I've been beaten over the head with Drakkon so much I don't care anymore...	None	the last few issues haven't been as good as the first 30 for sure, but they are introducing some cool stuff. the Omega Rangers are one of my favorite things that has happened in this whole series. I hope they get a series now that go go is done. then maybe we can get some more focus on the newbies in the main series.	0

fvb2ozp	T-34s are practicing for next week's military parade in Moscow. That asphalt, though :(	&gt; T-34 columns could be heard literally from tens of kilometers away.  That's because the T-34 tracks don't have anything securing the track pins in place, so instead there is a wedge of metal welded to the side of the hull, and any track pins coming out get smacked into place as they pass by the metal wedge, making that distinct click-click sound.	Yep. Shermans tended to be much quieter too. T-34 columns could be heard literally from tens of kilometers away.  Both tanks have their good and bad sides, of course. Take roads -- T-34s generally handled much better in the winter conditions. Shermans tended to flip on their sides on icy inclines, and at first they didnt even come with track spikes (or whatever these are called in English), though, to their credit, Americans quickly addressed the issue, as they tended to do.	T34s are notoriously bad on roads. One of the reasons alot of Soviet tankers liked there Sherman a hell of a lot more. Along with other things.	Our track pins are falling out!  German solution: let's re engineer the tracks so that we can have them secured in place  Russuan solution: weld a piece of metal to the hull and let it hammer them back into place	0

Like rock-paper-scissors but with more divine shield.	> I really don't like the idea of a build that cannot lose  There will always be a strongest build. Until the moment that one build wins every game (which isn't even the case with murlocs now) you realistically don't improve the endgame situation by removing megasaur. The only thing you can do is replace what the best endgame comp is.   And right now the best endgame comp is dragons, because they can get to large sized minions, have unstable ghoul to beat comps relying on divine shield, and have nadina to benefit from divine shields that don't get popped by unstable ghoul.

g2bsoa0	Late game enhancing tips?	he meant roulette on the backup gear.	> Repeate till everything is TRI, then do TET roulet.... and repeate....  Point 2, you advice against gs loss, point 3, you advice to do roulete, lol.	1. Go for sure you have enough reblaths on +14 (or militia)   I've 8 of each, it's saving a lot of walking (time) and is less tilting while creating FS. 2. If you want to do PEN BS, you don't want to waste your crons for regular BOSS Gear.   So, best way then, is in my opinion do work with a second gearset you can enhance freely, while your main gear can be used without GS loss. 3. If you still are on green/blue grade gaer, you can buy all Boss gear on PRI and enhance it in the roulete way: Means first do all on DUO, then TRI roulet. Repeate till everything is TRI, then do TET roulet.... and repeate.... 4. Best way to get Crons is to buy costumes from MP, it takes quite some time to get as many costumes as you need, means you have more as enough time to get the money needed to buy them. 5. Always do your rifts for mems and crons, but get yourself a fast horse and increase your GS, else it's not really worth because you gona spend to much time on it.	Its extremely expensive for a new player to get backup boss gear to fail a thousand times imo. Its just safer to enhance one gear at a time so you dont even need backup. And at least in SA we have Oasis backup for now.	0

g3g9bkx	How do you calculate the average tries for x to succeed with increasing odds every time it fails?	&gt;P(X=3)= (1-P(1))   &gt;   &gt;(1-P(2))   &gt;   &gt;(p+2k)  So by followng this and the one poussinremy said, if I calculate P(X=3) with the values that I gave in my example:     (1-0.03)(1-0.0335)(0.03+2(0.035)) =  0.0937505       does that mean I have 9.38% of succeeding in my 3rd click? Is that right?	Let p be the initial probability that the button will turn blue and k be the increase for when it fails. Let X be the number of trials until the button turns blue.  Now if k=0 that's just a geometric distribution and the average number of trials would be 1/p.  If k is greater than 0, it's a much harder problem. We can work out the probability distribution of X:  P(X=1)=p  P(X=2)=(1-p)(p+k)  P(X=3)=(1-p)(1-p-k)(p+2k)  P(X=3)=(1-p)(1-p-2k)(p+3k) and so on  If you multiplied p by a fixed value (say 1.01), I think we could work out a neat formula but  I don't think it's possible here. I would just spreadsheet this bad boy. The maximum value of X would be (1-p)/k, rounded up.	None	P(2) is not right in your formula: P(2) is not exactly 0.035 but 0.0335\*0.97 because, as said above, to succeed for the first time on the second turn, you must have failed on the first turn.  P(X=3) would give you the chance that you succeeded in your 3rd click, but that you also failed on the first and second click.  If you want the cumulative probability C, which means the probability that you have succeeded at least one time in 3 tries, you can add up like this C(3)= P(1)+P(2)+P(3)  For a more general formula, C(n)= 1-((1-b)\*(1-b-a)\*(1-b-2a)\*...\*(1-b-(n-1)\*a))  where each factor represents the chance of failing on a try.  This is a really interesting question ,may be you can get more help from r/AskStatistics or r/learnmath . I could write a program to compute C(n), however I am not able to write one to compute P(n) or the average because it takes too much time to compute when k is small. May be someone on these subreddits will be able to do it, though.	0

I'm certainly aware of it but I haven't seen it yet myself. I heard once that this tape was supposedly pretty rare but I can't find anymore info on it other than a quote from Bennett the Sage saying it was. Is anyone able to let me know if $3.95 was a good deal for this, still in the shrinkwrap. Also is Violence Jack worth watching at all? I enjoyed Devilman a lot but the snippets I gathered from Violence Jack makes give me the impression of all gore, and little of the story substance that got me hooked on Devilman in the first place.

g53n7c4	Is it unethical to rent out property at a loss? Not as a last resort but as an intentional practice?	Hell yeah, it'd kick ass if my landlord was a commie.  One of the biggest differences between many strains of anarchism and Marxism is that ethics or morality aren't a core component of Marxism. If you are an anarchist who basis your politics on balancing your ethical commitments, I'd love to be informed as to how being a landlord would tie in.  I'm a Marxist-Leninist for, in part, ethical reasons, but Marxism doesn't contain any ethical content. It is a social science that one can decide to practice for any reason they'd like. Even though the science is rooted in materialism, many Christians adopt Marxism-Leninism globally as an expression of their ethical commitments (see Liberation Theology)  IEthics is tricky, complicated, and often self-contradictory and grossly inconsistent. The only intelligible way one could define ethics or morality in my mind is to understand it as a highly personalized statement about ones feelings emotionally about an act or state of affairs.  **Bottom line:** OP should do as they please. They should know, though, that becoming a landlord will materially change their class interests. As to whether they can maintain an ideology that is antagonist to one's own interests is up to them and up to time to decide.	I would rather a comrade own the property any day	None	None	0

If your ideology doesn't exist outside academia and online Western internet circles, it probably isn't worth wasting your time with.  **Politics are about changing the world, they shouldn't be an expression of your individuality.**	The only reason such an ideology would ever exist is if some teenager just found out about political philosophy beyond liberal and conservative decided to mix and match random labels to try to make it sound cool.

Actually it is really good off-road vehicle, better than 90% of SUVs, also it's kinda cheap - costs about 8k$, but you need 8k more (at least 8) to modify it because it is extremely uncomfortable (very little is changed since 60s lol).

g6p25ow	New to the game, how do I use the inputs?	d, f, b refer to down, forward, and back, while QCF and HCF are quarter circle forward and half circle forward.  u/OldManAncestor	If you find the dpad on the PS4 controller annoying and you have some spare cash you could also buy a fighting pad, like a Fighting Pro Commander.  They're usually 30-40$  Remember that there are shortcut and alternate motions for special moves and CA's:  for example, Dragon punch can be input the regular, f,d,df+P method, or you can input df,d,df+P, or hold forward, then do a QCF+P fireball motion.   If you get accidental CA when you are trying to do a dp, make sure you are holding df and not f at the end.  If you get accidental Shouryuken when walking forward and trying to throw a fireball, do the fireball motion as b,db,d,df,f+P (HCF+P).  CA can be done the usual QCFx2+P way, or you can just quickly tap, d,f,d,f+P  It just takes a lot of practice.  If you get bored of training mode, you can practice in Survival Mode (in Challenges) too and get some fight money the first time you complete each difficulty with each character (just don't pay the 800 fm to continue if you lose).

gb0a6sp	How do you convert 800wh to Ah?	As a rough estimate, yes. But since batteries have variable voltage throughout a cycle, the actual value is somewhat higher. A typical Li-ion cell goes quickly down from 4.2 to high 3's then slowly drops to mid 3's then drops more quickly toward cutoff of 2.5. You'll see this in a 100v cycle because it goes down to mid 90's pretty quickly then slowly goes down to high 80's then drops from there.  However, as voltage goes down, current goes up for a given power draw. This is why it's much more helpful to look at the capacity of the battery in Wh. An EUC is much closer to constant* power than constant current use case.  *Obviously not constant but for any given set of variables (speed, weight, slope, etc) the power needed is the same.	watts = volts * amps  You will need to know the voltage to do the calculation. For a 100 volt pack 800 watt hours would be 8 amp hours.	None	None	0
gb2k98o	[Helman] Strictly speaking, it is correct to say Carson Wentz “led the Eagles to a win” on Sunday night against the Cowboys. But kind of in the same way that it sounds equally correct to say “two-time world champion and Miami Heat legend, Mario Chalmers.”	Jerry Jones fired Jimmy Johnson because Jerry wanted to take all the credit for the SB win Jimmy earned us. And all Jerry has done since then is prove beyond any doubt the exact opposite. That Jimmy was the reason we won and Jerry was just along for the ride. And bonus proof: Jerry was too self-unaware to understand that.	Its also correct to say we can say how much wentz sucks. How much philly sucks, but we lost. They made it to the superbowl twice in the last 16 years. The NFC title game five total times jn the last 20 years, and is the better regular season team inside of the NFC East in the last 20 years.   I hate tbe eagles as much as the next guy but the constant shitting on Wentz when its been over 25 years since we past a divisional matchup is just weird.	None	None	0

gbo1jve	If there was a button that caused US elections to switch to ranked choice voting, but votes were weighted based on state size as they are now (Alaska votes count for more than California votes), would you press the button?	Thanks for proving my point.  If that's all you can name, then it'll be impossible to see why the electoral college is here to stay (for now, at least).  And I'm not downplaying issues of discrimination.  There are things that need to be resolved there.  But that's only one of many issues (and generally not one best solved at the federal level).  And please, please, please don't reach for the straw-man caricature that racial discrimination is the number 1 political desire of the "fly-over" states.  What is it that THEY SAY that they want?  Do you even know?  Very few NYC or LA centered news outlets can tell you that, even if they were willing to.  (Please don't feel like you need to respond.  I'm blowing off a bit of steam here.)	The state-federal balance is fine now. The main conflicts these days are when states want to infringe on individual rights or discriminate against minorities.	Duh?  I know there are people who will really get hung up on the popular vote, but this would be a dramatic improvement.  To make a metaphor: which is greater?  -100 or -15?  They're both negative, but -15 > -100 every time.  \-----------  Slight tangent - Popular vote sounds good on the surface, but the more power is concentrated in the Federal government (particularly the executive), the more havoc it raises in less populated areas.  Thus, failure to attain balanced federalism creates an impetus away from the popular vote.  Doing away with the electoral college will absolutely require some sort of concession to states that will be truly hurt by the change.  We're not in the sort of political climate where deeply urban citizens can comprehend the needs of rural citizens, or can draft a reasonable compromise.  I don't see the popular vote happening anytime soon.  Prove me wrong.	None	0

gbqgxcg	Working on a mega tutorial on Modern Rails - what would you like me to cover?	Turbolinks has always caused js nightmares for me, and they are hard to track down. So I just remove it by default these days. Is it just me?	I'd suggest sticking with Rails convention of using Turbolinks unless you really need a reactive front-end.	None	Kinda depends on what you're working with...like if it's a bunch of old jQuery plugins, or maybe script tags from an SEO or marketing company, some of that might not work very well with Turbolinks. Neither will things like React or Vue, but you wouldn't need Turbolinks for that anyway, it'd just get in your way. Turbolinks has vastly improved since it was introduced, as well. I've used it with vanilla ES6 as well as Stimulus and it worked out pretty well. Didn't run into any of the "JS nightmares" that I used to encounter back when Turbolinks was introduced and jQuery was the order of the day.	0

gc0gnym	Did not think it was possible	It’s designed to hold the weight of a large male many times over.  However, it’s not designed withstand cyclical momentum-changing loads. Those loads are many times larger than a static load from a pull up.	Would've thought it was designed to resist downwards force more than lateral or upwards though as that's how most people would use it.	This isn't impossible odds at all.

EDIT: i see im getting downvoted. i dont disvalue his creation.. i do appreciate his time and efforts that he put into making this, it looks very cool. but does it really work practically? i feel like if candles were as predictable as this then there would be tons of people getting rich just by having bots do exactly what the candle-patterns tell them to do... seems to good to be true     EDIT: damn this got a lot of replies. thank you all for your comments. im gonna try to summarize it: TA is a self fulfilling prophesy. Candlestick patterns indicate current buyer/seller behaviour, and can together with other technical indicators somewhat predict the future trend  thank you all for helping im as i am very new to trading. if that summarization has any errors in it, please correct me.

gc61hp3	My share for this months end	Oh cool, that one day was last week so it might not even count against this one then	I believe you will get about half of what you wouldve received. Your hours became eligible in September and the quarter ended in October (October 23rd was the last day of the quarter) so your hours between those days will count towards myshare.   As for how much you will get: it varies by store so nobody here can answer that.	None	Man, you might not get one at all. You gotta be there six months (you started in March, so September would be your six-month), and THEN it’s a weighted total of all your hours for that quarter. You became eligible for MyShare in the middle of the quarter, so none of your hours will count. It’s actually NINE months before you’re truly eligible. Source: Walmart did me that way when I started.	0
gc8r9fe	Math is so much fun, isn't it?	Written language and computers follow different conventions. The equation in question is in written language, so unless the context is specifically about computers, what the calculator outputs is irrelevant.   The convention for a number attached to a term is that it scales the term. Unless you state otherwise, that’s the implicit meaning in fields of math, physics and engineering. Take a quick look at the equations in links below and see that it is true.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_operator_algebra  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity	my calculator says 16 therefore that is the objectively correct answer	This sucks.

gcpi3te	Yes, this is a poll about raiding and instances.	Because you're still in the open world, and people can see you fight the boss, which is immersive as hell.	Why is this superior to instancing the raid portion of a zone?	There is a compromise: Popped bosses. You do a bunch of stuff/farming/crafting to assemble an item that will spawn the boss in the open world. It will automatically be claimed by the group that spawns it.     Is it still possible to grief? Yes, but it's more limited.     On another note, then I would like to see stuff like BCNMs from FFXI.	I can't think of even one time in my MMO career, which started in classic EQ, where I saw another guild raiding and thought it was interesting at all.  In fact you almost never even encounter it except now and then when they rampage through wherever you are on the way to the raid area.  Like if you're in SolB and some raid wrecking balls through on the way to Naggy.  There's nothing all that interesting or social about that imo  There's a small handful of open world bosses, like say Gorenaire in Dreadlands, but I never found it all that interesting to watch a guild do a fight like that.   I think there's more immersion gained when you're in your raid, and you have a fresh, pristine instance to experience.  Like in the Plane of Hate for example.  It's far more fun and immersive to see a full, dangerous zone rather than a half-empty zone that you just walk to the end of because of groups keeping it relatively clear farming armor. And even for those groups, it's like I said above, you just watch the raid walk past, because raid bosses are rarely in the same areas groups are.  I don't think there's much of a loss without that.	0
gcpidbp	Yes, this is a poll about raiding and instances.	BCNMs (or Burning Circle Notorious Monsters) are instanced fights, that you have to pay an in-game 'fee' to attempt. They're somewhere between pre-endgame content and endgame content. Some of them are available even before the level cap. Each fight has unique rewards as well as other valuable rewards that can be hard to get otherwise. The fights don't take that long, but does require some investment in strategy, buffs and gear to beat them.  The entry to these fights is through Burning Circles, which are located deep inside dungeons, so you still have to do some work, to get to the fights.	I like this a lot, though I still would like to see a lockout timer for the party that spawns it. Only because, while the requirement may seem intense and unrepeatable when it's first discovered, inevitably raiding guilds will amass the supplies to farm the item, and thus the boss, and will need to be slowed down. But otherwise, I think this is a great way to let a group try the raid when they're ready on their own time, without being punished by raid guilds. :)  Now, I never played FFXI; what are BCNMs?	There is a compromise: Popped bosses. You do a bunch of stuff/farming/crafting to assemble an item that will spawn the boss in the open world. It will automatically be claimed by the group that spawns it.     Is it still possible to grief? Yes, but it's more limited.     On another note, then I would like to see stuff like BCNMs from FFXI.

gf60x9k	How can I connect with my higher-self better?	Thanks for the tips, will try those 2 breathing techniques. Are we just observing our thoughts and bodily sensations while focusing ng on our breath and not reacting to our thoughts until we reach stillness and then we are able to get into vibration stage? Are you scanning the body or anything like that or just observing and focusing on your breath? Just curious how you specifically meditate for astral purposes because I tried just observing and letting go in one meditation session and I got up to the vibration stage after a while but it was a small vibration and I became attached to the outcome and I stopped vibrating	Wim hoff or the dmt breathing technique work for me very well in the beginning, also just being patient and letting the mind run its course then after about 20 minutes its done and I start to let go and get deep into it	What's your tip on getting into tue vibrational stage quick?	So what works for me is I do my chosen breathing method and then lay down on my back and only give attention to my breathing. While focusing on my breath I slowly relax all of my body from head to toe starting with my face, I like to feel the earths gravity pulling me into my bed to help me relax. the brain goes through thoughts and stuff that happened through out the day, you just observe those thoughts and after they run their course they will pass, just focus on breathing. After about 20 minutes for me my mind has cleared and I move into the vibrational state. Still focusing on my breathe, this is when my body begins to fall asleep and astral projection becomes more possible, I have only scratched the surface of astral projection through meditation. It’s all a work in progress. I suggest the “wake back to bed” method for astral projection. I hope this helps thanks!!	0

ggi0yyn	I have been told to get off of reddit for my mental health but the instant nature of reddit makes me feel good. People talk to me here, in real life they don't. How do I deal with this?	What is the purpose of hate?	Hi justinjamm, I hope you and your loved ones are doing well. Ive always thought of you as a beacon of light back then, and honestly am slightly hurt but understand why you blocked me.  Getting help is difficult, I have a hard time expressing myself and my problems. I don't want to hate myself or anyone but it feels so innate to others. When others hate it's ok. When others hate fascists it's ok. When I do it it's not. I realize I have little self awareness on a deep level. I can't handle being wrong or people disagreeing with me because that makes me feel stupid therefore not worthy of life.  I do hate myself. How do I fix that?	You have serious emotional/mental health problems suggesting you need a therapist very badly.  The extent to which you treat things in life as "blatantly objective" and have so much hate for anyone you see as "wrong" creates a very unstable situation for you.  It means you're right on the edge of hating YOURSELF, every moment, because it's so humanly easy to be in error all the time on all kinds of subjects/topics.  I couldn't even respond to your post at first because I had blocked you years ago when it became obvious you needed a kind of help you cannot get from Reddit.	Without hate we cannot get rid of evil.  I hate pedophiles, do you?  I hate myself, I want to die. I want to know the most efficient way to do so. If it makes the world a better place for me to die then I will do it.	0
ggih901	"Cyberpunk's gameplay sucks" yeah, sure...	Yeah, my first thought in response to this video was "... jumping around doing flashy shotgun takedowns on mostly braindead enemies doesn't make the gameplay great".

Much less flashy, visually boring, but still representative of "gameplay".  I enjoyed the game well enough too, but I don't let myself be blinded to the game's numerous flaws.	I think, in a way, you are proving their point.  One of the biggest complaints I see is poor AI.  But also none of this proves the bugs don't exist or that the game is stable on console, for example.  Bottom line, there is a shit ton to enjoy in this game, there are also a shit ton of things that steal your enjoyment that shouldn't be there.

Um yeah.. if a speed runner who’s claiming he got a top 10 time is not only proven to have cheated, but also doubled down when presented with the indisputable facts, then he deserves to face reproductions.

If this happened to some random person you wouldn't be surprised, but because it's a speedrunner, he deserves to be cancelled.	If you knew anything about math or statistics, you’d know that it would be basically impossible for dream NOT to have cheated. You say that neither side can be proven but the numbers literally prove that he cheated lmao	Again. Not statistically impossible. Just super unlikely. Listen, I'm not saying he definitely didn't cheat. I'm saying there's a chance he didn't and that nobody can prove either side. In addition, there are millions of ways to calculate statistical analyses, especially when it comes to a fictional video game. If you just saw his speedrun and never saw the video claiming he cheated, you wouldn't be so adamant. You'd have just said "whoa, he got lucky" and moved on.

ggzfljg	How do you feel about how computers are described in old scifi?	They had displays (you sometimes see them, the output resembles the image from a microfilm reader), but floppy discs were beyond them; the small yellow rectangles they use for portable storage are said to be "tapes". I don't think they did that badly considering what computers and computer literacy were probably like in the '60s. Even if the showrunners had known better, the tech had to be somewhat recognizable to audiences of the time as well.	That's the reason why I feel amused while watching original Star Trek. I mean come on, no displays, punch cards, floppy discs?	None	They did amazing job with TNG though. Tablets, voice control, touchscreen only control etc. That was far beyond it's time.	0

If the bank did know and reviewed the security tape and found the kid who found it, he would be completely fucked.	I worked at a sack n save in TX. The cart pusher was a kid with mental disabilities, and while pushing found an unlocked bank bag with over $30k in it. Gave it to management who immediately called the bank and returned it.  No one would have known, too. The banks were befuddled why it was there, as in no one was frantically asking about it. The kid was just too unequipped to see the windfall. He literally could have just shoved it in his bookbag and into his locker, there were no lot cameras and the store ones were black n white with bad v hold lines in half of em.

Yes, not all accounts have the same tasks. My friends and I not having the same task, I've already check. You can see the " **Some tasks that you can make much more money based on my experience:** " section of my posts, I sort it from the highest earn to low. So you can consider to do.

Btw, I can't believe that I've earned over $200 from Toloka also lol  Edit: About the Bixby and Google task, you must download their mobile app and find inside	Hmm. That's mad earnings on a Russian site. You have put in so much effort on this site, probably 10 hours a day.  My problem with Yandex is the extremely low pay. The average average hourly rate is $0.5 and that means you have to be up-and-doing. I don't know what you mean by Bixby tasks. I registered as a Brit but I don't see that many tasks. Also, I have to use Chrome to translate to English, almost all jobs. Is yours any different?   I am surprised at your earnings to be really honest.

ghioa8w	Cousins.(art by Padeliciouss)	They kind of do, if you take them for what they are. The books aren’t written for adults, so the themes, wording, and overarching plot structure are all simple when compared to fantasy written for adults, but they’re still well put together.	The movies suck and the author hates them, as has been discussed (and linked to) elsewhere in this thread. The books are better, though I have no idea if they hold up for adults.

ghj5he4	Anyone take hydrocortisone (or alternatives) to help with thyroid?	Agreed, but I said hydrocortisone, not prednisone. The latter is 4 times stronger than the former. 25 mg of hydrocortisone would be equivalent to 6.26 mg prednisone.  The human body produces around 40-60 mg cortisone per day.	Even considering taking 40mg prednisone long term just to combat fatigue and the "clearance of cortisol" is a bad idea, especially when you haven't even checked your cortisol levels, and even then an AM or random cortisol test is not very informative. 24hr urinary cortisol would be better.   Then there is the side effects of adrenal hypoplasia, immune suppression, and a bunch of other things.   If you've ever been on high, long doses of prednisone, you'd not even be asking this.   It's a horrible idea.	None	The problem with hydrocortisone is the short, variable half life.

gi17iqc	The “is it hypothyroidism or something else?” discussions.	On the association between higher norepinephrine and hypothyroidism: https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article-abstract/35/3/359/2685797  On the effect of norepinephrine on TSH: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3015564/#:~:text=Thus%2C%20it%20is%20concluded%20that,effect%20of%20TSH%20in%20vivo.	>stress from the excessive norepinephrine  Do you have any papers on that?	There are two tests that you can do by yourself to determine if symptoms are due to hypothyroidism.  One is the basal body temperature test, where you test your body temperature first thing in the morning (before you do anything -- just reach out and grab the thermometer): the more you're lower than 97.8F is the degree to which you're probably hypothyroid -- although you could have an adrenal issue or a mast cell issue (which causes increases in body temperature).  The other is the ankle reflex test: the longer it takes for your ankle to relax after being contracted when hit with a reflex hammer, the more likely you are to be hypothyroid.  Both of these tests have lost their appeal since the overemphasis on TSH testing.  In terms of lab testing, by far free T3 is the best measure.  TSH can be falsely lowered for a multitude of reasons, including stress from the excessive norepinephrine that happens with hypothyroidism!	I found those, but they're talking about TSH-induced thyroid hormone secretion, not TSH secretion?	0

gi5k7in	Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline WILL go ahead with EU support, regardless of American sanctions, says Russian Deputy PM	This gas most likely replaces coal in Germany which reduces CO2 emissions. Gas power plants are also more flexible, so this probably allows for a larger share of renewables.	Other than having to trust Russia and increasing global warming, nothing is wrong with this.	None	While there are some good aspects, overall this is a step backwards. The money should be spent on green solutions, not investing in a long term natural gas solution.   Have you seen any climate analysis on ground to power with  natural gas (methane) vs coal? CO2 is not the only problem.	0

I didn't play Vanilla, but I did start in TBC right after in launched, and I guess I didn't realize how much had actually changed even low level for classes between Vanilla and TBC.

I'm actually now considering making a wider and cheaper desk by combining three 2x12 6 foot sections of pine screwed to two perpendicular three foot sections of 2x12 pine near the ends.	Three 1/4-20 bolts will hold a few hundred pounds collectively. I am more concerned about those inserts ripping out of the birch. They are pretty thin.	Legs I'm considering attaching to a 1 3/4 in. birch tabletop (for a computer desk) have 8 holes for screws. They are orientated in a triangle so if I only do the corner holes I would only need 3 screws for each leg. I'm considering 25mm (about 1 inch) threaded inserts for easy removal in the future with machine screws (a little over 25mm to match the inserts and legs).   Are 3 screws on each leg strong enough with threaded inserts?

I was halfway through about a minute long explanation and when I looked up she was writing an email.	Not only is this 100% adorable, but this interaction shows how supportive they must be towards each other.

Not everything should be taken in such a personal way, most people reflect on self thought.

Yeah but it really saddens me how he seems so disgusted to learn shes transgender.

Very mild soreness in a couple days but nothing crazy. The numbing shots on the other hand - that's the worst pain I have ever felt. I had 4 shots in each toe. Of course it was temporary and went away right after but I refuse to do that again.	Thank you for answering - how was it to get the nails removed? Did it hurt at all - or is it like when you get teeth removed and it just feels very, very strange? And I completely agree that this wont go away on its own. Should I try the GP/doctor again or find a specialist foot doctor?	I'd say it's damage of scarring of the nail bed by trauma (long time standing and poor fitting shoes). You can see from the ridges of the nail that it's become thickened in response to the trauma. Nothing much you can really do my friend apart from having the nail removed (which I did as mine were much worse that yours).	None	0

I only ask, because I just thought maybe the whole money being equated with elite status could be a result of the US focus on hyper-capitalism.	Because in my experience in the majority of cases the "elite" aren't superior in terms of abilities or qualities, but rather in terms of financial assets and nepotism.  I suppose that you could argue that the rich are objectively "better" thanks to the world class educations they can buy, but in practice we have seen in recent years those who got "the best" educations and still turned out to be quite ineffective at leading their country.  Having a fancy education is not a guarantee of political acumen as it once was. If it ever was.  Hypothetically I think that most would agree that some sort of meritocracy or technocracy where a nations best and brightest make informed decisions would be acceptable, if not preferable, but in practice corruption would be unavoidable.  Just my two pence.	None	0
gispqu5	Let there be Carnage	Agreed. The movie wasn’t that great but I was pleasantly surprised that they put a lot of comic Venom into the movie. I.e. Venom being its own character with the talking head and such. I was disappointed with the standard movie plot and the copycat bad guy. Tom Hardy carried the movie.	Venom was horrible, no excuses, they got everything wrong. What carried the movie was the popularity of the character. Venom put asses in the seats and then Sony disappointed the minds connected to those asses.	The secret to liking Sony superhero movies is to lower your expectations. Venom was recieved well because most people expected it to suck and were pleasantly surprised when it didnt.   If you go into carnage expecting it to be anything but 'ok', or worse, than you're gonna walk away disappointed.	None	0

gix092w	Medication Monday	In what type of situation and what is your level of medical training?   To anesthetize and suture wounds is pretty far from "first aid", considering I don't know of many paramedics that have that ability. If you're concerned about first aid, you should be focused on bleeding control, i.e. having adequate amounts of gauze and trauma dressings, and tourniquets. A tourniquet can stay on for several hours without causing any permanent limb damage, which should be enough time to fly you to a hospital if you're in a remote location.  I'm not even sure how you'd go about aquiring drugs to anesthetize, as I don't believe lidocaine is sold OTC, same with suture kits.	Is it a good idea to include a kit for sewing a wound? Including local anesthesia. In a first aid kit?	None	None	0

That's what I'm saying and I got downvoted to hell. Gusse it's only acceptable to be homophobic when it's people we dont like	let's not use homophobia as an insult, okay?

You get a 200/213 piece every couple of weeks, in my opinion it would've been fine as a campaign end reward.	Did...did they expect to get like a 233 for doing a solo quest chain?  Too bad it's not a trinket, I already got a 187 weapon from the Vault a couple weeks ago :)	[https://twitter.com/Wowhead/status/1349049408181080066](https://twitter.com/Wowhead/status/1349049408181080066)  This thread on twitter perfectly captures the thoughts of /r/wow, people are so entitled.	What do you mean by getting a 200/213 piece every two weeks? It's certainly not from the covenant campaign or any other solo content.  I think 200 would have been fine as it's just above the end-level of the campaign gear. But man, calling the current reward a "joke" instead just doesn't sit well with me, especially as your weapon is generally the largest power increase, and the campaign rewards are obviously not meant for people who are raiding.	0

gj4vskd	When Will There Be a Junior Heavyweight Wrestle Kingdom Main Event?	I can see the cruiserweight Championship headlining an episode Of NXT but definitely not even a C level PPV like battleground. In the same way I can see the Jr. Heavyweight title headlining something like Kizuna Road, but not something like Dontaku.	Yeah, it's like Rey Mysterio winning the WWE championship at WM, but it'd be ridiculous for the cruiserweight championship to ever headline even a small WWE PPV. And realistically the same can be said that for the intercontinental and us belts there. In NJPW, the IC title has broken through the strict heirachy once, through pretty crazy circumstances. So I don't think it'll ever happen	Naito is a junior heavy who is called a heavyweight, and he's not the first one. I think having two people under 100 kilos in the main event is about as close as your are ever going to get, but it will be for the IWGP heavyweight belt.  In pro wrestling (except in mexico) heavyweight has become synonymous with "top" and the junior heavyweight belt is seen as a solidly midcard title on the same level as the US / IC title at best.  I don't see this changing but would love to be proven wrong. I mean, even the name "Junior" heavyweight has implications.	None	0

gj7i6d9	What's Something From Canon That You Hardly See In Fanfiction?	This! Everybody seems to think that the argument is whether or not Naruto was always an idiot or always smart.  He was pretty dumb at 12/13, for various reasons including things like nobody helping him and Kishimoto wanting an excuse to explain the rules of the world.  Plus because it's Shonen, its pretty easy to just look at all the crazy power buffs he gets over time, but he's actually shown to get both more thoughtful and more tactical as time goes on.  As far as I can tell the only reason he's still considered an idiot by the time Pain comes is because Kishimoto didn't want to scare people off by getting rid of the remnants of what he was beginning of the series.	Naruto did start off pretty dumb but I he also got smarter throughout the series	None	Ya man, Naruto is used as a tool for exposition of different concepts throughout the series and that overshadow his smart moments.	0

gj8v98x	Echo is one of the best projectile DPS now, but is she OP?	&gt;&gt;If you die in it, you need to stay dead imo.  &gt;If that happens, this will discourage Echo players from copying anyone but Tanks with the fattest HP.  This is already generally the best play in most situations, and the ones where it's not won't really be affected by the removal of her death immunity during ult. If you're ulting a dps as Echo, it's usually because you know you're in a position to get that hero's ult without getting "killed" and knocked out of your own ult. This just forces you to be more aware of taking unnecessary risks that waste your ult, because now you'll die in addition to not getting any value from it.	> If you die in it, you need to stay dead imo.  If that happens, this will discourage Echo players from copying anyone but Tanks with the fattest HP.   > It feels super cheap to press it at a tank just to save yourself from dying and no doubt get a free tank ult in the process.  Indeed, but there's also a risk when copying a Tank because Echo's ult form can feed ult charges to enemies. In higher tiers, players react smarter because Echo universally tells everyone what she copies as and they will all just focus-fire on her. E.g Echo copies DVA, then everyone sticks to a natural cover just in case a self-destruct mech flies in; Echo copies Zarya, everyone scatters to avoid being grav'd together; Echo copies Reinhardt, everyone will run out of her melee + shatter range while shield Tanks will hold up their shield more as they all expect Echo will throw everything to build shatter; etc. Some players don't even mind to solo-ult Echo's ult form as a trade.	Her ult is a get out of free jail card. It shouldn’t be. If you die in it, you need to stay dead imo. It feels super cheap to press it at a tank just to save yourself from dying and no doubt get a free tank ult in the process.   I feel like everyone’s frustration with her comes from the ult and not the rest of her kit.	None	0

gjakuei	What if /r/GoldAndBlack gets banned? THE SUBREDDITS PLAN.	Interesting. I understand where you are coming from and I agree. If someone entered my property right now began to cuss, set the carpet on fire, or do anything I perceive as disrespectful and I kick them out, can they claim on principle, that I am being antisocial? When I find their behavior antisocial? Who will be the one being antisocial when technically both are? Legally I will be in my right and under principles, unless outlined and stated by the rules of the construction we agreed upon before their entrance into my domain. This boils down to perspective and the bigger idea of context. I’m the spirit of the principle how do we combat bad faith actors when both parties have a right? By principles which leads to interpretations. I see your point of view clearly. It’s an attack on the spirit/principle of freedom of expression while exercising their freedom of expression and private ownership. This I think is resolved by context. In what context	The US constitution prevents the *government* from infringing on speech, but a private entity infringing on free and open communication is still anti-social and harmful.  >Freedom of speech is a principle we all stand for and whats going on isnt an attack on freedom of speech.  This is a very misleading logical path.  What is going on is not an attack on the legal "freedom of speech".  ***However***, it is absolutely an attack on free and open communication and expression, which is the principle underlying the legal right.   It ***is*** absolutely their right, and it is absolutely our right to call them out for their shitty behavior and to seek better alternatives.	Lol the irony. Private corporations have their rights to do what they want with their private platforms. Freedom of speech is a principle we all stand for and what’s going on isn’t an attack on freedom of speech. It’s their right. On the other hand it’s like trying to clean the carpet with high powered lasers. I think the best move is to create our own platforms.

gjcoypp	Government prepares for morons to behave moronically.	People can have different beliefs.  They aren't morons because of that.  When facts are available and you choose to ignore those, then act like a moron based on "your feelings" rather than the widely available facts....then you're a moron.	Stop posting this and advertising this little meet and greet of theirs.  Also, they might have wildly different beliefs, but calling them morons just pushes them further to the fringes and only serves to continue the "us vs them" mentality. Notice how the governor blames outside groups of influencing/manipulating vermonters and didn't blame people directly? That wasn't an accident.	None	I think what you're trying to convey is that there's a lack of nuance. Like it's easy to group people into a subset of a stereotype rather than to get to know them and actually see what their core beliefs are and where they are divergent from group think. it's kind of like how in Vermont we have Republicans but they're very much a rhino more so than Evangelical Christian pro-life crazy Republican. but then again we have our fair share of crazy asshole Republicans up here too. But the difference is if you take the time to actually get to know some of these people and understand where their beliefs and philosophies are - you may be surprised. I know that this goes against the narrative that all Republicans are bad and everything else but I know who I am, I'm not a bad person, and I'm not a white supremacist. I don't even believe in half of the pro-life bullshit that the party spews. I just want smaller government, civil liberties and freedoms. And allow me to be 100% clear I do not endorse the crap that happened down in DC, I support Joe Biden as our new president Even though he's from the Democratic party and that's supposed to make him my mortal enemy by default of me being on the right but it is my belief that whoever our president is deserves respect and support until they lose that by their actions. I understand that Biden has a little bit of a tattered past being involved with the crime bill and his support primarily coming from segregationists in the beginning of his career but the past is the past and people deserve a second chance. Hopefully he does well for us and I hope he does because no matter who our president is we should hope that they do good for us. That being said I think that Trump is a piece of shit, liar, and asshole. It'll be good to see him go and hopefully he will never come back.	0

gjfo4nw	Unpopular Opinion: Glad this sub had dropped the farm murder theme.	A ‘bit spammy’ is a rather trivial way to be referring to a serious issue. Either the issue is discussed and solutions formulated to make a positive contribution or not. Just sweeping it under the carpet is worthless. But hey, it’s spam, so annoying that it overcomes the importance of the lives lost and solutions to be found.  As for taxes, as many people need to financially emigrate as possible. It’s not easy, but unless the Western Cape gains independence, then the only other option is to leave.	Its not representative of the sub. I don't read or comment on anything on them, there isn't much to say about it, we know the police are doing nothing. And from what I've seen not many other people comment unless it's some high profile article. It just seems to create a narrative that this is what this sub is about. It's a bit spammy to be frank.  The reality is the problem stems from corruption in government.  And using the whites as scapegoats to justify the wholesale grand scale theft of state resources going on at all levels.   I pay a fuck load of taxes, and in return I get the middle finger from my government because of the colour of my skin. The problems in SA are bigger than just farmers. The tax base leaving SA is largely not comprised of farmers.	I think the challenge is that the overall farm murder story is being suppressed by the vast majority of other media outlets. The result is that the news stories from those horrible events are inevitably are concentrated into whichever means of media that will carry them.   I think that the awareness needs to continue to be increased and therefore this sub should carry these stories.	None	0

gjlksl8	How do I stop letting players do whatever they want?	Not just "Yes and", but also "Yes but".   Those are hallmarks of any form of improvisation.	Saying "Yes and" is often seen as the mantra of a good DM, going with the players and expanding on their ideas. What is often forgotten is that saying "No but" is also important to the experience too.  What it sounds like you would benefit from is making rulings and sticking to them. Then bringing clarifications to the next session. Insist these players questions can wait to the end in the interests of keeping the flow of the game.   With players that don't want to cooperate with the group, that's on them to figure out - you can ask them what they're doing while everyone else is doing the main thing and manage them a little bit that way but your job as DM is to facilitate their decisions, not to be an intermediary in their squabbles.  If they remain a disruptive and negative influence, talk to them after the session about it, remind them collaboration and compromise are the bedrocks of the game and if they're going to kick up a stink every time their needs aren't met they can leave.	None	* Yes and (something else good happens) * Yes but (it doesn't go as well as you hoped) * No but (it's not all bad) * No and (it's even worse than you thought)  These four responses are your guiding light.	0
gjlm2i1	Challenge Rating for PCs	Sure, but that is supposedly how CR is calculated.   Most indeed know CR is a fickle thing, which doesn't even take action economy into account.  Nor the magic items, party make-up, party weaknesses, creativity of the players, ...  It is hardly even close to exact math.	That's not really how it works at all.  A CR 1 creature being equivalent to 4 level 1 PCs would mean it is a 50/50 fight, when it actually is a very easy fights for the PCs.  Level and CR aren't the same, but that kind of math just doesn't work. A level 1 PC is much closer in power to a CR 1/2 creature than 1/4, and at higher CRs that math breaks down even more.	Level and CR are not the same.   And action economy is more important than challenge rating.  A CR 1 creature is roughly equivalent to 4 level 1 characters.   Which would make a level 1 roughly have a 1/4 CR.   If you draw this line through, you'd need a level 20 character to go toe to toe with 4 level 5.   And even then I'd still give it some minions and legendary actions.	That is not how CR is calculated.  CR is calculated by taking the average damage and average AC/HP and using the tables in the DMG.  The idea of CR has never been that a CR X creature would be equivalent of a party of 4 of level X, that would be a pretty bad way of doing it because it would mean CR = level encounter would be far too deadly.	0

gjnxxnv	Favorite Marvel Graphic Novels?	The Dark Phoenix saga was epic, yes (until they inevitably un-killed the tragic figure they had given us. Until they did that, it was the best tragedy of the Marvel universe, *ever*). I also enjoyed the Simonson run in *Thor;* Beta-Ray Bill remains a favorite character. His ability to pick up Thor’s hammer and put it to good use beat the cinematic Captain America by decades.  But as I said, DC manages to have more critical + popular acclaim runs and stand-alones.	>its hard to think of a Marvel graphic novel that enjoys both the critical acclaim and popularity of a number of DC titles:   Marvel does really good runs, they were never really into the graphic novels thing.  There's lots of amazing and classic Marvel collection volumes of said runs, which are functionally the same as graphic novels.     (The Dark Phoenix Saga, for example.   the Simonson Thor run,  which was massively popular,  etc.)	Honestly, it’s hard to think of a Marvel graphic novel that enjoys both the critical acclaim and popularity of a number of DC titles: *Watchmen*, Neil Gaiman’s *The Sandman*, *The Dark Knight Returns*, *Kingdom Come*, *The Killing Joke*, and even *Fables*.  Marvel Studios has done a far more competent job than DC/Warner Bros. in bringing their IP to the screen, but DC still seems to have all the best graphic novels of the “big two.”	None	0

None	That would be nice but I'm also kind of over characters with special or rare powers. Seen it too many times.

A federal pardon doesn't get you out of state prosecution, and a witness could invoke the 5th on the grounds that they're still vulnerable to prosecution in some state.

I can't count how many times I was put in the running for a job that wasn't a good fit, but the recruiter kept trying to skew the situation to convince me otherwise. Huge waste of time.  The only good recruiting experience I had was for an international job, and a couple years later the recruiter went out of business after getting caught doctoring fake degrees for applicants.	3rd party recruiters (Headhunters) generally have a good reputation with the clients they work with. I would highly encourage you to rethink your preferences. A good lead is a good lead regardless of the source.   There is a time and place for headhunters. If they dont consistently provide quality candidates, they are often not retained for future services.   A good recommendation from a quality headhunter tends to carry more weight with me. They have skin in the game.	None	None	0
gjscaui	Hollow Knight is such a slow burn of a game that I'm only finishing it now, after over 3 years of trying and 5 attempts to do so. Ultimately though, like the best slow burn experiences, it's very rewarding in the end.	I mean you beat the game and 99% of the content at that point. I'd say you finished it just fine.	Yea I think we all have our  breaking point with the game. Mine was the final dlc where you had to >!consecutively beat like every boss in the game.!< My buddies was the >!3rd trial of fools!<. It's my favorite game of all time and even I technically didn't finish it :(	I have a love - hate relationship with this game. Got stuck on the mantis lords and I'm not sure if it's worth it to keep going.  It REALLY punishes you for dying.  With very distant checkpoints and losing money.  I had enough of that crap in the 80s.  But the control, atmosphere, etc are great.	None	0

gjsnsn6	Help pregnant wife	If you can, carve out half a frozen peach and put the sorbet in the peach half (like a sorbet bread bowl).	If you have a vitamix, sorbet is supppppper easy to make..	If you can’t find it in store, you could try making it for her! Doesn’t look difficult. Just frozen (I’m guessing defrosted) peaches, sugar, a little lemon juice, and a blender/food processor. [Here’s one recipe I found](https://www.aheadofthyme.com/3-ingredient-peach-sorbet/) with a quick google, but I’m sure there are others.	None	0

gju6bn1	$15 Minimum Wage?	But demand goes up with cost, so there's no need to increase prices or cut workers	Raising the minimum wage could mean less money to fewer people; fewer jobs, fewer hours, higher requirements for new roles created to justify the cost; more exploitation as anyone who chooses to work for less than $15/hr rather than $0/hr would need to find an employer willing to break the law to accommodate. Exploiting migrant workers is already happening and people are generally fine with it; this change could simply expand the effect.	None	None	0

gjucqi0	Atleast it was removed before it could be tainted by 2020.	The problem is that outside of farming the mats for the boss, the event is done with once you go through it the first time unlike plague star which has a bunch of rewards that’s good for the first time, arcanes, weapon parts, some mr fodder, and later a shit ton of forma.

gjudhqb	Atleast it was removed before it could be tainted by 2020.	The problem is that the players are so fucking powerful in basically all senses, including optionally durability, that in order to create any challenge without nerfing us, a failure condition besides our (6) full deaths (not counting downs that result in revives) needs to be put in place.  So we protect a thing. Defence is an option, but that means one place which is often boring, so mobile defence it is.   It’s just the design corner they’ve been backed into honestly, which is a shame because their gun designs are inspired, they aren’t shit game designers, they’re just cornered	One day, I dream of an operation event that isn't just a glorified Mobile Defense. Scarlet Spear added some variation with the Railjack squads but the rest are always the same formula :(	None	Yeah, I understand that completely.   If it was something like Escort, there would be complaints of boredom.  If it was Assassination, it would be immediately destroyed.  If it was Defection..... hahahahahahaha.	0
gjufou0	In mid-December, a model from the CA government predicted 75K COVID hospitalizations by mid-January, steep growth from the 16K then hospitalized. Yesterday, CA had less than 21K COVID hospitalizations.	The staffing argument is valid, I've worked in health care.  As I am getting used to saying, nurses are not plug-replaceable units.  You can't just take an unemployed pediatrics nurse and drop him/her in an infectious disease ICU.  That doesn't count as "qualified" by any means. Same with MDs and most other specialties.    I'm surprised there is no support for re-training unemployed medical workers though.	Every one I remember seeing has proven itself to be between 50% and 90% overstated. Our death counts ended up being 10% of what the models were forecasting.  One of the cities here went from three overflow hospitals to finding locations for one back in April, then only building a permanent one which has never been staffed. They claim they don't have the personnel to staff them....despite the state's NG being given authorization from our governor to send its stock of nurses and doctors to do it.  It makes me wonder of it was just the usual bureaucratic waste or if they've got a future use in mind for the facility...	In all honesty have we seen one single Covid related model turn out to be correct or even close in the past 10 months?	Here's the rest of the issue with that hospital. It's not meant for critical care patients. There's no ICU, come to find out.  It's more like a rehab hospital for middling cases. To me, it seems that it wouldn't be as hard to find nursing staff for convalescent cases as it would be for critical ones.   But they didn't need it and won't. That's a whole nother argument. They cried and cried about possibly opening it for months once it was complete, yet they haven't even moved to bring in staff for it.	0

gjupw8a	A cycle of boons inspired by /u/TheGameV's Grave Ritual	You want to provide an example? Because I don’t see any.	Black can still technically get Rituals, but they require an additional "Black" cost like life or other permanents.  I would argue it is still a bend, but given the Morbid and Threshold requirements to go mana positive on it, you could *probably* get away with Grave Ritual in a supplementary set.	I don’t think black gets rituals anymore.	From the MCP2017 Article:  >**Mana production, temporary**   >   >Primary: red   Secondary: black   >   >Red is the color best at producing temporary bursts of mana, be it with one-shot spells, permanents with one-time triggers, or things that need to be sacrificed to be used. Black can also get mana but usually requires paying some cost, most often sacrificing something else.  I know some of these don't technically count as proper "Rituals", but they are still temporary mana generation:  * \[\[Songs of the Damned\]\] reprinted in Ultimate Masters. * \[\[Priest of Forgotten Gods\]\] from RNA * \[\[Bone Miser\] from C19 * \[\[Liturgy of Blood\]\] from M14, reprinted in Battlebond  Black also dabbles in permanent mana generation, usually at a cost or restricted to Swamps. ie \[\[Cabal Coffers\]\].  \[\[Gnarlroot Trapper\]\] from Origins is in a weird middle ground, being a subset mana dork, but costing you life.	0
gjv1g2u	In mid-December, a model from the CA government predicted 75K COVID hospitalizations by mid-January, steep growth from the 16K then hospitalized. Yesterday, CA had less than 21K COVID hospitalizations.	&gt; 50% and 90% overstated. Our death counts ended up being 10% of what the models were forecasting.  Since so much of the discussion is statistic oriented I just want to make a correction on your comment.  IFF death counts were 10% of what was forecasted, that was an overestimation of 900% not 90%.  If you predict 100 and the answer is 10, you were off by a factor of 10 or over 900%.  Off by 90% would be a count of somewhere between 110 and 90. It's a percentage of the actual number, not the prediction.   Mixing these concepts is a lot of what media has been doing.   If something *in a fixed population of say 1000* increases from 10 to 20 it didn't go up by 100%.   It increased from 1% to 2% or by 1%.   In some sense, yes this is an increase of 100% if the population you are looking at is the affected one.  It's not if you are looking at the entire population.  Conflating these two terms is a source of fustration.	Every one I remember seeing has proven itself to be between 50% and 90% overstated.

In all honesty have we seen one single Covid related model turn out to be correct or even close in the past 10 months?	Valid point. I cannot math well sometimes. So yeah, the death counts here were 10% of what was predicted or 900% overstated. Which is even more damning a number to look at than 90%.	0
gjv209p	Would this be keto-friendly if taken in moderation?	&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;	I'm trying to cut down on caffeine and I've realised that I am drinking too many cups of decaf coffee. I can't stand herbal teas. I have though about drinking barley and chicory coffee and this is the only one I've found without added sugar.  I know it contains 80.8g of carbs per 100g. I wonder if I take 2 max 3 teaspoons a day, would that be keto friendly. I have no idea how many grams of carbs it would be per teaspoon. Maybe you folks have a clue.	None	None	0
gjv57yn	Russian Back flip tomahawk throw!	This actually bothered me a lot in the new movie Soul. (minor spoilers below)   Joe dies suddenly, and for the entire length of the film, he NEVER not even once wonders how he died. He is obsessed with getting back in his body, he never stops to worry if his body is still on one piece, has a giant hole through it, etc. He never stops to think, "If whatever killed me broke my arms or hands, I won't be able to play piano tonight."  And we actually don't learn how he died either. We know he fell, but he has no visible injuries. Not even black and blue bruises or a single cut or bandage. Did he just get scared to death?	And the crazy thing is ain't no kill cam in real life, so homeboy going be in the afterlife wondering how he died	None	I watched it with my kids and was also confused. I thought maybe I missed some context about how he died but I guess I didn’t.	0
