7,c5lt2ty,Who else is sick of constantly seeing this kind of junk in the women and feminist subs?,"&gt;MRA people really only want to take down feminism
  
The logical fallacy you are looking for is called [Hasty 
Generalization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasty_generalization). Might as well say all feminists are man haters with your logic.

","I agree. I'm a guy and think that the way that gender roles affect men is important, but MRA people really only want to take down feminism, as if it has been so institutionalized that women no longer experience oppression and it's just a tool to keep men down. If they really cared about their own rhetoric of ""fighting for equality"", then they would reach out to feminism. But no, *their* struggle has to be more important and if a feminist doesn't reach out, it's their fault and not the MRA's.

EDIT: Went to /r/feminisms, saw that Audre Lorde quote, subscribed.","The women's subs are full of MRAs asserting that we need to start taking steps to reach out to them. One even told me that I'm ""not helping bridge the gap between MRAs and feminists""—when I responded, I was told to go [get raped](http://imgur.com/zCRaJ).

We don't need to reach out to these people because their goals are different from ours. They're not so much looking for men's rights as they are looking to destroy and defame feminism. When you look at their sub, it's mostly sexist crocodile tears and abject resentment of complaints lodged by women. We don't need that kind of stuff here.

They're of no use whatsoever anyone.","Perhaps /r/MR has gotten better since I last went there, but the vast majority of posts and comments were anti-feminist.

The second isn't really a red herring. If anything, it seems to be just trying to shift the nature of the argument from straight morality to morality as determined by practicality, which is not a logical fallacy. 

If these are the examples used by OP's English teacher, then it sounds like he needs a new one. Of course, that might a bit of a hasty generalization on my part. ","At least based on your retelling of it, the problem I see is that your teacher is inappropriately dismissing complaints as logical fallacies when that does not apply. 

""Circular logic"" and ""begging the question"" are when you start with the assumption that your desired conclusion is true and then make an argument in favor of the conclusion. What you are describing doesn't sound anything like that.

The ""red herring"" argument I guess could apply, depending on the context of the conversation. If someone keeps deflecting conversation away from current problems with the death penalty towards some ideal system where everything is rainbows and sunshine when that's not the point of the discussion, and using this to argue that the death penalty is good, then that could be a red herring. But bringing up secondary argument is not always a red herring.

No, that's an anecdotal fallacy. You were correct in starting off by stressing 'tend to', but didn't reinforce it at all. The study isn't saying ALL men/women act a certain way, but in general most do.","TEND TO being the operative words here. My husband is a creature of habit who refuses to deviate from the usual path unless absoloutly necessary, whereas I am always looking for better routes and shortcuts. 

It all comes down to individuals. Perhaps some men are more gifted at navigation. Perhaps some women aren't risk takers and comfortable being creatures of habit. The article mentions some women were as effective as men at the test, but it did not mention if the reverse was true. Plus, thinking about the way the test was administered suggests many men and fewer women would immediately adapt to the computer simulation, based on their own mention of proficiency with video games being the key to performing well on the test. 

It appears that what they really tested was how well you can navigate a computer maze; NOT how well you navigate a car.

229,f3d5sa7,Rant: I have a love/hate relationship with the r/keto,"So, you completely missed my point in my r/feminism example.   
   
You are completely confusing terms.  You throw around ""cultish"" ""faith"" and other words with a religious connotation.  Cool.  Gotcha.  
    
Of course, you have allowed a logical fallacy to cloud your perception.  Take a minute and check out the fallacy of hasty generalization.","No, I didn't go to r/feminism and comment because a)I am not a woman, and b) I generally support the goals of feminism. I posted it here because I follow keto and think it's a useful diet and sub, but also think that some equanimity / moderation is needed. 

Now, what I mean by cultish behavior is related to the first point: some people see keto as an end all be all, as a miracle cure for all their ills. This leads them to dismiss anyone who is not ""inside the circle"". It's classic sect behavior. Again, I said some, a minority, but oftentimes, people who are driven by those feelings dominate discussions. 

To reiterate: I like the sub, I love the people who post, I relish the inspirational stories. But bad advice, or some sort of ""gate keeping"" actually damages the sub / diet, instead of helping users.","To your first point, ALL posts asking for medical advice--any medical advice should be reported so that we may remove it.  Too many keyboard cowboys in the world.             

To your second point, you are saying a subreddit devoted to EATING a ketogenic diet is cultish is rather foolhardy.  Did you head over to r/feminism sub and post that all the talk about women's issues is a bit cultish?","I beg to differ: I did not generalize; rather, I said that some people, some users, etc. I took pains to explain that it was probably a minority, but pointed out that often enough, vocal minorities dominate discussions. 

""Cultish"" might have religious connotations, ""faith"" does not since it's used in many other fields to generally mean trust in something (i.e. faithful execution of the law, faith in your peers, etc.). Perhaps I should have used ""trust"" instead. Nonetheless, I used cultish deliberately, because, as I explained in the post, some users DO have that sort of behaviour. 

As far as the fallacies goes... my statements don't fit any of the formal definitions of informal fallacies (including ""hasty generalization""). At least I don't see how they do. Perhaps I need to read more philosophy or you need to read more formal logic.",0,,,Some keto users treat it like a cult

","I didn't claim it was a study.

But I think some other comments here offered pretty good explanations for why a derm might choose retinol instead (including that they are promoting their own line of products).",The sample size is SIX. That's way too small to make even the weakest of generalizations.
