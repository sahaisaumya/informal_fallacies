The reasons you gave are not logical or rational or reasonable. Some are perfect examples of logical fallacies. They don't work any better for minor wrongs than they do for major ones.

The Argumentum ad populum fallacy (""Everyone I know does it"") is still a logical fallacy whether it applies to lying or terrorism or littering. Same for the Appeal To Tradition fallacy.
","I see where you are going, but bad example. There are different levels of morally bad and I don't think suicide bombings and eating meat are even close to the same level of bad. I gave the example of lying about how a pie tastes above. That would be similar in my mind. Rewrite your little scenario:

&gt; I think it is morally wrong to engage like about things and won't change my view on that. Despite believing that, I still lie about liking my mom's pie. Everyone I know lies about little things like that. I was raised doing that. My significant other lies to me about whether or not she can tell I lost weight. To avoid supporting lying would make my life significantly more difficult. I don't know how to live life without telling at least small lies. My mom would be crushed if she found out I hated her pie. ","If someone else engaged in a different immoral behavior but for the exact same reasons that you do, would you think they are justified? For example:

&gt; I think it is morally wrong to engage in suicide bombing of innocent civilian targets and won't change my view on that. Despite believing that, I still support suicide bombings of innocent civilians. Everyone I know supports suicide bombers. I was raised supporting terrorists. My significant other is a bomb maker. To avoid supporting terrorism would make my life significantly more difficult. I don't know how to live life without helping to commit violent terrorist acts. I would need a separate religion from my family. Etc.

If such reasons are insufficient justification for other immoral behavior, why is it ok for any immoral behavior?",None,0,,,It's easier to just eat the meat.

50,dui79v7,Is tipping 15% just not enough these days?,"You saying that 15% “has always been appropriate” to support your point is actually an example of an Appeal to Tradition fallacy. Just because 15% was a good tip in 1990 or your baby boomer parents told you 10% is the standard and 15% is for good service do not mean that is still the case. Inflation is real, times are a’ changin’, and your server still needs to pay their bills. ","Ah the old, ""if you can't afford to tip well, you shouldn't go out to eat"" gambit. Or how about ""if you can't understand that people tip based on the quality of their service and 15% has always been appropriate"" you shouldn't be a waiter ploy?","I’m a server at a nice but casual bistro. My tips average between 18% and 25%. Based on my experience 20% seems to be the norm now. 

Personally, I only tip 15% if the service was distinctly mediocre. For good service (i.e. prompt, friendly, handled any mistakes appropriately, etc) I always tip 20% or more. If the service was excellent or I’m a regular at the place, I tip 25% to 50% depending on the amount of the bill. If the bill is cheap (like under $10) I leave a flat $5 - why should I only pay $1.50 for someone to take care of me when I would receive the same level of service if I’d ordered more expensive items? 

Going out to eat is not a frugal behavior in the first place. If it’s something you want to do, budget for it and enjoy yourself, but don’t try to save money by under tipping your server.

The appeal takes the form of ""this is right because we've always done it this way.""

An appeal to tradition essentially makes two assumptions that are not necessarily true:

The old way of thinking was proven correct when introduced, i.e. since the old way of thinking was prevalent, it was necessarily correct.

In reality, this may be false—the tradition might be entirely based on incorrect grounds.

398,f94publ,The Cambridge Union gives in to 'anti-islamophobe' pressure,"That’s  called ‘argumentum ad antiquitatem’ to use a phrase that might have been adopted by any number of Cambridge philosophers who contributed to the waning of religious influence on intellectual thought. 

The RHA 2008 entitles citizens with the following right . Time to protect this...‬

“Nothing (shall) prohibit or restrict discussion, criticism or expressions of antipathy, dislike, ridicule, insult or abuse of particular religions or the beliefs or practices of their adherents”","Unfortunately it's a needlessly crass and confrontational comment which was always going to cause this kind of mindless response which shows he's unsuitable for the role he was up for. 

It's important to challenge religion but doing so in this manner can only devolve it into a shouting match that will achieve nothing. 

Also in the UK there is no separation of church and state as the church is part of the state. 

The history of Cambridge university is also intrinsically linked with organised religion. Homerton was set up to originally to educate Calvinist ministers, Trinity is named for the holy trinity, Peterhouse was founded by a Benedictine Monk and is named for the apostle Peter.

 I'd be more surprised if you found any part of the university that has always been completely secular.",None,"To take your 2nd point first the RRHA 2006 (http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/1/contents) was a joke of a piece of legislation from the start that even secular groups didn't want to pass. Then the Lord's watered it down to be essentially meaningless before it was passed. 

While I agree that religious thought has waned in its influence (and that Cambridge scholars of many types not just the philosophy contributed to this) it still has plenty of strength left. Especially in places that have strong historical ties to religion, are so firmly a part of the British establishment, and still adhere to plenty of their own antique traditions.",0,,,The claim of this argument is that there was nothing wrong with The Cambridge Union condemning Islamophobia.
