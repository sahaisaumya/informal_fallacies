dh1b6fr	FARM has launched a new campaign to encourage Pizza Hut to offer Vegan Cheese	Pizza Pizza in Canada already has what they call "Dairy-Free Cheeze". It's coconut based and really good. That's the only place I get pizza anymore because they are the only chain I know of with vegan cheese.	The first major pizza chain to offer vegan cheese will get so much extra business for life, I can't believe someone hasn't jumped on it. I wouldn't even think the cost to them would be that much as I already have to pay $2.50 at mellow mushroom and my local pizza place to sub vegan cheese on any pizza, which is honestly ridiculous but oh well...   Seriously though: Dominoes, Pizza Hut, Papa Johns, if you're reading this, the first one of you to offer vegan pizzas with vegan cheese will have my business for at least the next 10 years, probably for my life.... And I'll probably order 2 pizzas a month. (Provided your local location doesn't fuck my order up too often... Which will probably be your biggest profit loss [even though that will be passed off to the franchisee and not your corporate bottom line.])	None	Yeah. My wife and I lived in Toronto last year before moving back to the states. Shortly after we left, Pizza Pizza started doing dairy free, and we were so sad.  The amount of money we spent having UberEATs deliver Apiecalypse was insane. Lol.	0
dha7tbs	CMV: Name calling and refusing to address political opponents' issues is bad for both sides	&gt; I think you hit the nail on the head here in terms of why, but I still see the problem of it not actually help produce good policy or legislation.  It doesn't, I agree. But sadly it works well with no repercussions (for the party, the country pays the repercussions). Just the past election, we elected a demagogue, simply because demagoguery works.  &gt; What it is leading to, and we see it more now than a decade ago, is obstructionism for the sake of power rather than compromise for the good of the country.  Again, more statements I agree with. But sadly, there's not an easy solution to the problem. How do you get the majority of Americans to vote with their heads and not with their guts?	I think you hit the nail on the head here in terms of why, but I still see the problem of it not actually help produce good policy or legislation.  Sure, people can get angry and vote, but most voters have a very limited scope of the issues they are voting on, and can be far too easily swayed by campaign rhetoric. The goals of the DNC and RNC is to get their respective candidates elected to office, not to enact legislation that is beneficial for our society. They simply use issue and rhetoric as tools to achieve their goals of getting their party elected. It's a shame really, and it is creating deeper divides in america because of the amplification on social media.   What it is leading too, and we see it more now than a decade ago, is obstructionism for the sake of power rather than compromise for the good of the country.	> How does being divisive actually help your political strategy.  Very simply put, angry voters... vote.  Non-angry voters have better things to do.  The strategy of inciting your voter base works.	None	0
dha97lv	CMV There is no solution to far right extremism save legislating against hate speech and removing children from the homes of convicted parents.	To clarify your edits:  &gt; I am not a US citizen but rather of a country where hate speech is already a crime and where we do not have an equivalent to the first amendement guaranteeing free speech in all circumstances.  Yes you do. Assuming you are part of the EU, you are bound by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The second title explicitly guarantees the Freedom of Expression which is another way of saying Freedom of Speech.  &gt; I am talking about european countries where hate speech is already a crime, please stop telling me how it works in the US, it is not relevant to this case.  Hate speech is also a crime in the US.	I do not live in the US. In my country the governing principle is that your liberty ends where another's begins. We do not have free speech nor do we want it. We prefer respect.	For the US, this is a very simple counter: The First Amendment.  Removing children from their homes is a government action. And you're saying the reasoning for it is because of what the parents have to say. This is *exactly* what the First Amendment aims to protect.  > Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.  You say it's totalitarian, and I agree, it's totalitarian.	I am but the EU charter of FR does not guarantee you the right to say the sorts of things bill o'reily says on a daily basis 	0
dhasenm	CMV: The average American is too ignorant for a democracy to function.	That's a false dichotomy. It is not the case that a republic is not a democracy.

dhax8ni	CMV: The average American is too ignorant for a democracy to function.	&gt; We had a mild constitutional crises last year when the GOP refused to have a hearing for Garland.  What crisis? It was a sleazeball move but everything was legal and within the law. Also, as long as the SCOTUS has a quorum of six members, it's fully functional.  Lets just talk about the crux of your view:  &gt; So to answer your question, a functioning democracy is one where things get better, not worse.  I'd say that this is a nice-to-have. Not a must-have. Forward progress is not the goal of a democracy nor a measure of success.  *"A democracy is government in which power and civic responsibility are exercised by all citizens, directly or through their freely elected representatives."* Basically, as long as everyone is free to vote and have their voices heard, then that's a functioning democracy.  I would personally say things like voter suppression laws and gerrymandering are detrimental to a functioning democracy. However, currently nobody is being forced to vote for anybody and, to my knowledge, there is no significant voter fraud. Thus I would say that we have a functioning democracy.  Everyone who's in office was voted in there. Nobody's established themselves as a dictator and everyone can/will be voted out of office and their children won't take over when they die in office.  I mean, I agree. I **hate** the current state of our government. Our current body of elected officials leaves me queasy. But it's far from a non-functioning democracy.	We had a mild constitutional crises last year when the GOP refused to have a hearing for Garland.  We have a federal government where the group representing the minority views of the country have the majorities in the legislative branch.  Despite having the most wealth, we continue to fall further and further behind the rest of the industrialized world in nearly any metric you'd care to mention (healthcare, education, life expectancy, etc.).  So to answer your question, a functioning democracy is one where things get better, not worse.	Could you clarify what you mean by "to function?"  What is currently failing to function?	> A constitutional crisis is a situation which a legal system's constitution or other basic principle of operation appears unable to resolve; it often results in a breakdown in the orderly operation of government. Often, generally speaking, a constitutional crisis is a situation in which separate factions within a government disagree about the extent to which each of these factions hold sovereignty. Most commonly, constitutional crises involve some degree of conflict between different branches of government (e.g., executive, legislature, and/or judiciary), or between different levels of government in a federal system (e.g., state and federal governments.  >A constitutional crisis may occur because one or more parties to the dispute willfully choose to violate a provision of a constitution or an unwritten constitutional convention...

dk4fw01	Truth.	Yes, plants have no nervous system and as a result can't feel pain. The funny flaw in the argument that "plants feel pain" is that more plants are required to feed the animals to produce meat then if you had just eaten plants directly.

dk4gauj	Truth.	Hi, im trying to understand your point, are you saying that since eating meat is not illegal, then it is not necessarily morally wrong? I don't think this post said anywhere that meat eaters are rapists and I apologize if you took it like that. 	I know they think that it's wrong, but morals deal with what is right or wrong regardless of opinion.   If eating meat is morally wrong, then what is the penalty for doing so, and who is going to exact said penalty?  Rape is wrong regardless of opinion, thus it is morally wrong. Saying that meat eaters are rapists is not a defensible argument and it's rude too.    If someone wants to oppose meat eating for reasons like treatment of animals or cruelty or something, that's fine. Not every meat eater agrees with gross mistreatment of animals either. The argument against eating meat presented here is really an emotional one. Somebody is imposing their personal preference disguised as a moral standard on meat eaters. 	None	None	0
dkx3mc1	Brexit and the Loss of Financial Passport: How are the Brits being Fooled?	MiFID II includes equivalency regimes for only about 25% of financial products covered by the regulation, which of course can be withdrawn at 30 days notice by the Commission.	The entire article, as short as it was, failed to even mention MiFID II and AIFMD, two massively relevant pieces of legislation once we leave the EU.

Party B says no, so Party A tells them to go fuck themselves.  Party A is India. Party B was the EU. The EU state responsible for that position was the UK. The minister in charge of overseeing migration policy who wouldn't budge was a certain Theresa May. 	How do you think negotiating works?	Well that's pretty retarded then.

The UK is not part of that scheme as it has an opt-out in the treaties. So, yes the people are misinformed.  &gt; Especially if Germany starts awarding citizenship en-masse to the people they let in before.  This is literally made up. We have a lot of Merkel hate on here as parts of the alt-right have become fashionable, but this just isn't how German citizenship actually works.	> The amount of times I've heard 'I voted Leave to stop them Muslims coming in...'.  I get that you think these people are stupid and misinformed, but have you missed the entire discussion about African migrants to the EU and Brussels imposing quotas? It's all the European press talks about at the moment. Italy has announced that to relieve the pressure on itself it might start awarding these people visas so they can legally travel anywhere in the EU.  The current trends in the EU are towards allowing large numbers of Muslim migrants to enter and roam the continent largely unchecked, and quite possibly legally. Especially if Germany starts awarding citizenship en-masse to the people they let in before.	Leave voters probably don't know which countries are members anyway. The amount of times I've heard 'I voted Leave to stop them Muslims coming in...'.	> The UK is not part of that scheme as it has an opt-out in the treaties. So, yes the people are misinformed.  Migrant quotas don't appear in any treaties. Do you think Hungary or Poland signed a document that said "your funding will be removed if you don't take unlimited quantities of Muslim migrants"?  They never did.  Moreover the EU routinely ignores its own treaties and does whatever is politically expedient in France or Germany - many voters are well aware of this and can cite many times that it's happened, even for Remain voters, so "the treaties" is not a good answer to such people. They simply have a different judgement to you with regards to how much predictability such treaties give ... especially had we voted Remain.  > This is literally made up. We have a lot of Merkel hate on here as parts of the alt-right have become fashionable, but this just isn't how German citizenship actually works.  Even the most sober analyses from pro-EU outlets say "we don't know if this will happen" (which is also what I said - emphasis on the word *if*). For instance the BBC:  http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36169684  Or Open Europe:  http://openeurope.org.uk/today/blog/eu-migration-crisis-will-refugees-acquire-full-free-movement-rights/  And like I said, Italy is now using the threat of legalising extra-EU migration as a way to negotiate with the EU:  http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/830382/Migrant-Crisis-EU-cracks-Italy-hand-out-visas-migrants-Mario-Giro-Germany-France  > In a bid to deal with the crisis, Italy threatened to invoke wartime legislation to hand out 200,000 temporary EU visas to asylum seekers which would allow the migrants to legally travel north using a Brussels directive. The Italian Government believes that they can exploit European Council Directive 2001/55, which was put in place after the Balkans conflict to give temporary European entry permits to a large number of displaced people. Mr Giro and Luigi Manconi, a senator with the ruling Democratic Party, confirmed to The Times that the visa idea was being discussed.   Deciding to what extent staying in the EU affects Islamic migration is a tricky and nuanced judgement call that relies on a lot of intuition about the future of German and EU politics. But so far, given the incredibly lax approach to African and Middle Eastern migration by the EU, it's not unreasonable at all to extrapolate that out further. Especially because the UK's opt-outs in the case of Remain would have very likely come under attack (what are we going to do if they're removed - leave?). The realpolitik of this situation is a lot more complex than you appear to be giving it credit for.	0

do8t85b	Whats your opinion on eating insects and bugs?	I think that consciousness is not a binary thing but a grey scale. Perhaps bugs are generally-speaking conscious but maybe not the same degree as pigs or cows or humans. That would mean killing them is bad, though not as bad as killing a pig or cow. 	Bugs are basically just little organic robots, right? Dont really have a sense of consciousness or awareness in any real capacity, they just carry out their instincts in a fairly mindless, sometimes hive-mind fashion. Cant speak for vegans but youd have to be a next level pacifist to be against killing bugs from an ethical standpoint.

dpdfv6n	Drunk girl slaps a cop. Cop retaliates with excessive force. Or does he? Or does he not?	The biggest problem I have with cop apologists is that there is never any compromise. Cops can do no wrong.  I can compromise and say that the girl shouldn't have slapped the cop. Obviously a poor life decision and her parents should be ashamed. But I wish a cop apologist would say, "Yeah, maybe punching her lights out was justified, but a teeny bit excessive. Just a bit."

dpvjmag	Before the AMA even began, StarWarsBattlefront mods are deleting top and gilded comments. Stick around as the games begin.	From what I can tell, #3 is not met in two different ways.  First way: You don't own anything. All digital products aren't owned by you. They're owned by the company. I believe the ToS almost always says this. So there's no "prize" since it's not yours.  Second way: It's not a monetary prize. A prize is something offered that has a value. Certificates or trophies having no resale value would not be considered prizes. The "prize" has no value outside of the game, so it's not a prize.  Although I agree with you. It's gambling. But legally it's not. Until they update the definition.	Pretty surprised the conservative controlled government hasn't taken a stand on these lootboxes. They clearly violate online gambling law.  It requires 3 things;  1. Consideration - you pay money to have a 'chance' to get a thing OR have to put considerable equivalent non-monetary (time) cost 2. Chance - you only get what you're looking for with a certain percentage chance 3. Prize - anything of value (skins, weapons, etc)  I honestly don't see how it can even be argued these are not gambling. I think everyone is just waiting for the precedent to get made in court.	**Request:**  > Lootboxes should be removed. These ruin the feeling of accomplishment, are a form of gambling, and are obviously an incentive for players to buy credits using micro-transactions. Currently, Battlefront feels like a free mobile game, not a $60-$80 AAA title. There should be absolutely no micro-transactions that affect progression. While we recognize that you need money to continue creating free DLC, it should not come at the expense of fair gameplay. A compromise can be limiting lootboxes to cosmetic items only, so you can still make money.  **Answer:**  > I think crates can be a fun addition as long as you don't feel forced to engage with them in order to progress. I feel that's where the issue is with our game right now and that's where we'll look to solve as quickly as we can. We're looking to add additional ways to progress your favorite character or class, while allowing crates to be a fun thing for those who want to engage with them.  Yes. Gambling is fun.	You're probably right, that's likely the argument they would make, but I don't buy it. Virtual items objectively have value, people sell their accounts for games all the time. Maybe it's against the terms of use, but it's pretty damn hard to argue there's no value. If there was no value they wouldn't sell the boxes for money.	0

No idea what you're talking about, or why a murderer is vegan matters at all. 	I don't care to discuss it with someone who is snarky, arrogant and contemptuous.

But, we use most of the cow when it is butchered. The sharks have just their fins carved off dumped in the ocean. Most of us non vegans would not fuss if the whole animal was put to use.   E* and who collectively came together to be the arbiter of right and wrong when it comes to the food chain?	I will never understand people that view this as bad, but eating cows, pigs, etc as okay. You can't pick and choose. It's all wrong.	[removed]	0
dtfrdbg	Chill with the evangelical hate	Conservatives here often claim that the Episcopal Church is only pro-LGBT and pro-women-priests because we're "following what the world wants" and/or "ignoring the Bible to suit our own beliefs." Sometimes those posts get deleted, but it's common to see them in any LGBT-related thread.	> We get shit on by the conservative evangelicals all the time. All the fucking time.  Maybe show us a couple of such posts in here?	We get shit on by the conservative evangelicals all the time. All the fucking time.  Sucks when the shoe is on the other foot.  I know you guys aren’t all slavering Trump brown-shirts, but enough of you are that it’s made for some really ugly politics and a stain on the reputation of the entire church. So, no, I don’t hate all evangelicals (or any of them, really), but the substantial majority that make excuses for evil need to repent.	What's your point? Both of the things you mentioned are obviously against the teachings of the Bible. Is it somehow controversial to point that out? 	0
dtozn6k	A professor explains why he believes the evangelical church will one day accept evolutionary biology.	Because evolution underpins most of our understanding of modern biology, and it's necessary to have a proper understanding of it in order for science (especially medicine) to keep progressing and making life better for everyone. And I've noticed that evolution-denial is highly correlated with denial of climate science, which is a huge issue if you believe humans are supposed to be good stewards of the wart.  Also, denying evidence because it doesn't fit one's worldview is just wrong. It's driving people away from Christianity when they associate all Christianity with being anti-science.	I'm all for science and theories are fun but why does it matter so much *how* he did it? He did it. That's it. 	None	None	0
dtrlm5z	Help on snacks	Adding on to this: I've recently seen frozen seitan bacon added to my local Walmart's vegetarian/vegan freezer. Might be worth a look. It's a block, so you'll have to slice what you want, but I'm pretty sure it's at least by weight about the same as you'd get for "real" bacon, and for about the same price. I can't find it on Walmart's website, however. It was in brown packaging with a Victorian-esque portrait on it.	Since you like sandwiches, do a "B"LT.  Lettuce and tomato, either by itself or with Bacos (the soy stuff) sprinkled on it.  I don't know if you're doing eggs, but I like egg salad.  Granted, you'd have to keep that handy or else you're doing some cooking.  Peanut butter is an easy option.  Bagels with cream cheese.  Have it with a veggie cream cheese and some sliced cucumbers and tomatoes.  Cheese sandwiches are good, but can be boring, yes.  Mix it up a bit.  Add lettuce, tomatoes, sprouts, pickles, whatever you want.  Buy a variety of fancy mustards and try them out in different sandwiches.  Get a variety of rolls and breads.  I'll do sandwiches on toasted English Muffins to keep things interesting too.  I also do veggies and dips, a bowl of cereal, cheese and crackers, taco dip and chips, pretzels, popcorn, etc.	None	None	0
dtro15f	Do vegetarians understand how quinoa and avocado damage human lives?	It's not really even true. It would appear that everyone in Peru, at least, has benefited in increased income from the rise in price of quinoa. In fact, the poorest Peruvians seem to have gotten the most from it.  As for diet/nutrition, there was no significant change in calories, protein or carbohydrates. Doesn't say about fat intake, but I can't imagine it being much if any. Some places consumed less quinoa, others actually increased their consumption.  Even then it seems that it's not actually a staple-food, like rice, corn and wheat, but rather just a dish of cultural importance.  Basically just TL;DRing this NPR article: https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/03/31/472453674/your-quinoa-habit-really-did-help-perus-poor-but-theres-trouble-ahead	Its also interesting those are used despite them being available forever lol 	God, this article is so dumb.  Right off the bat, just from the title alone. They're implying only veg eat avocado and quinoa, when the reality is the majority of people eating them are not veg.	Oh no I agree, it just odd that this writer (being misinformed for an article) went after vegetarians and those two items exclusively.   I’d love to see what data (if any) he used to get this article published. 	0

dtujrjv	‘If you don’t eat meat you’ll get anemia!’ What do you think are the most annoying vegetarian comments?	I've pointed it out to them, man. They just ignore it and keep spouting garbage.	O man.

It's been scientifically proven!"  like what  also, not necessarily related to vegetarianism directly, but: "Vegetables are the food *my* food eats.." SO funny right xDD  Another one in recent times is the dumb soyboy shit.   Other honorable mentions:  "Vegetarian food is so expensive!"   "You can't get B12 without eating animals!" and subsequently when they find out you can supplement "If you have to supplement a diet, it's not healthy!" and  subsequently when they find out there's vegan foods that have B12 in them "That doesn't count!"

I know a pescetarian who refers themselves as a vegetarian, but that's only because no one in our area knows what the hell a pescetarian is and thinks it's a religion.  Of course for the people that *do* know what it is, he calls himself one.	I actually know a pescatarian who refers to himself as a vegetarian. While ordering shrimp and other fish dishes.

You should run HH, the thuds get you in the feels even more because they are longer and still weighty!	Hammer.  While I love the spin-to-win (both horizontal and vertical versions), that's not what gets me.  It's the feeling of swinging a hammer into a massive monster's face and making it actually stagger back.    It's not death by 1000 cuts.  It's not cheating and using a gun.  Oh no, I'll get right in your giant, razor sharp, slathering face and stand toe to toe and swing that hammer so you KNOW that I am the hunter that made you stop and go "Maybe this wasn't such a good idea...".	When I was using hammer I felt kind of like a dwarf swinging a human sized weapon, which don't get me wrong felt satisfying; but the HH made me feel like I was regular size and clubbing people.	0
duxf667	Two player multi feels so unrewarding	I think that depends on whether you like extrinsic rewards or intrinsic rewards.  In a game that's basically all grind, I think you need a good appreciation of both.	It's not really a problem, so far we took out everything except Tempered Kirin which got to us today (so this is kinda me venting about it), but it's silly how much easier solo play is. I want to play with my buddy but the game is telling me it's much more rewarding in game to play solo.	It hasn't been a problem for me.  2 man allows for both of your Palicoes, which adds a ton of support if you're using Vigor Wasps or the Coral Orchestra.	Also Kirin is a pain in the ass. Screw that lightning-shrouded thunder pony of carting.	0

dva62iz	If ‘A Wrinkle In Time’ Is Stripped Of Its Christian Themes, The Film Can Only Disappoint -- Christianity isn't just a minor element of Madeleine L'Engle's fantastic story, it's at the deepest center.	Agree. The review embargo hasn't even lifted, so we can't even read what professional reviews are saying about the film yet.	Personally, I find this article way too premature. There is no indication that the director of the film has stripped it of its Christianity. The author would be wise to actually watch the film before levying criticism at the risk of otherwise seeming unnecessarily reactionary.	None	None	0

dw241vi	I quit MH:W without noticing. That makes me sad.	I'm in the same boat.  I just naturally stopped playing as the grind started to get... grindy.  I had a fantastic time playing when I played but killing the same few monsters over and over started to get stale, even after swapping and trying different weapon sets.  It's no criticism of the game, I put in over 100 hours, I just felt like I was done with the content that I enjoyed.  I also plan on coming back for Deviljho for a bit but it probably won't be for terribly long.  And I'm okay with that.	I've been done for a couple of weeks now. I put in about 100 hours, had some really good gear and was getting into the tempered hunts.   Ultimately I just didn't think tempered hunts was enough to keep me going. Aside from learning how to play with a new weapon (I'd played the entire game as SnS and only tried other things in the training area), there wasn't anything left for me to keep coming back.   Knowing that I'd killed every different monster multiple times, with nothing new coming other than slightly harder versions, pretty much stopped me playing. I love everything about this game but with less time for gaming and other commitments, such big grind for little (personal) payoff wasn't worth it.  I'll definitely come back for a bit once the new update for Deviljho is out, but I'm sure I'll put it down again shortly after that too.	None	None	0

dx2euxc	In 2004, Mark Zuckerberg Broke Into A Facebook User's Private Email Account	&gt;or (b) a blanket logging policy that was just logging *everything* entered by a user.   Are we not all aware that this is a thing they do yet?   You can type in a FB text box and delete it without submitting, and that text is still captured and stored. It's a trivial thing to implement.   It's been a couple years since an article came out that described how they were trying to determine why some posts were not submitted by looking at the content of unsubmitted posts users made.   I don't see how any of this recent news is shocking anybody: "Collector of massive amounts of data collects and uses massive amounts of data."   	One thing that caught my eye is that Zuckerberg used Facebook's logs of failed login attempts, which **contained the incorrectly entered passwords**.  This is an *enormous* privacy no-no.  Capturing and storing the incorrect entries puts your own users at great risk (because a malicious actor could use them just like Zuckerberg did); meanwhile, there is basically no *legitimate* use for them.   So the only reasons one would have to store those incorrect entries was (a) the desire to capture them to use for this sort of attack, or (b) a blanket logging policy that was just logging *everything* entered by a user.  The former is evil; the latter is even mind-bogglingly dumber (because it's capturing even more private sensitive data).	None	Sure, but were they doing it in 2004?	0

dxyma0b	Converts to other denominations, how well did you understand your former denomination?	They let your grandmother be a deacon? That's kind of cool, I guess.  Women aren't allowed to be deacons in my parents' church, for... reasons.	Nearly the exact same experience with me, except it was my grandmother who was the deacon.	Baptist --> Episcopalian  I understood my parents' church's beliefs very well. My grandfather and father were deacons, so it was very integral to everything we did as a family. Calling it "theology" might be a bit of a stretch though, since that particular church's beliefs were 90% Republican politics and 10% theology.  I came to the Episcopal Church after picking up some of the Church Fathers and realizing that a lot of what I had been taught did not line up with what I was reading.	"Deacon" was pretty much "food-bringer". She wasn't allowed to teach any groups with males in it, even toddlers.	0
dxyoxdu	Converts to other denominations, how well did you understand your former denomination?	Good question. I believe the Catholic and Orthodox churches are *prima facie* wrong about several issues such as LGBT rights and women's ordination. I was very drawn to the "three-legged stool" approach of Scripture, tradition, and reason.  I found it especially hard to reconcile what I perceive to be those churches' sexist positions with modern science. (I'm a medical student especially interested in disorders of sexual development and working with intersex patients; I see lines drawn between men and women as arbitrary and ultimately impossible to defend).  I think that the Episcopal Church does a good job at balancing those three facets, though of course they aren't perfect. I love the tradition but am also happy to attend an ELCA Lutheran church with my in-laws, so it's less of a draw toward the denomination itself and more of the way they approach faith in general. Hope that answers your question!	How did you read the Church Fathers and end up Episcopalian, rather than Catholic or Orthodox?	Baptist --> Episcopalian  I understood my parents' church's beliefs very well. My grandfather and father were deacons, so it was very integral to everything we did as a family. Calling it "theology" might be a bit of a stretch though, since that particular church's beliefs were 90% Republican politics and 10% theology.  I came to the Episcopal Church after picking up some of the Church Fathers and realizing that a lot of what I had been taught did not line up with what I was reading.	Thanks for answering my question!  Onto LGBT rights and women's ordination, there is absolutely nothing to suggest support for homosexual marriage in Scripture nor is there anything sacramental in Christ's conversations with women - it seems as if you're trying to adapt Christianity to your world beliefs, rather than the other way round?  I wouldn't call the Church sexist. The person we say to be highest in Heaven - Mary - is a woman. We believe in the roles of the household as laid out in Ephesians 5:22-33 and in the historic teachings of Christianity, namely that, because Christ was speaking to the all-male Apostles when He said "do this in memory of me" (when He ordained them priests/bishops), and because gender is an ontological mode of being, Christ wanted an all-male priesthood - otherwise, He would've ordained Mary!  I would also note that due to changes in the Edwardine Ordinal in 1552, which the Anglican Church later noted had errors, your Church has lost its Apostolic Succession! Be careful.	0
dyrylnd	What is something that really freaks you out on an existential level?	Live with a man 40 years. Share his house, his meals. Speak on every subject. Then tie him up, and hold him over the volcano's edge. And on that day, you will finally meet the man.	That no matter how much you get to know someone, no matter how much you share your life, learn about them, feel as though you are almost the same person, there will always be an infinite gulf between who you think they are, and who they really are.   You cannot know someone else. You can only know your perception of them. Your experience of that person flows through the filter of your personality, your experiences and memories, your biases and intuitions. You don't know them, you know your conception of them. Subjectivity of experience makes truly knowing another person completely impossible.  We are all perfectly isolated souls, completely separate from everyone else, desperately reaching out to convince ourselves we aren't really alone. 	None	None	0
dywrtj9	McCain still up for a fight, even in illness.	I guess what I meant is that they aren't really doing anything to fix it persay, just dealing with the pain.  Which is horrible and obviously I would love a world with none of it, but it just seems like we make patients out to be heroes.  They don't seem to have much choice in the matter.	Obviously you haven't had first hand experience with cancer. If you think it's not a fight to live with the pain, the sickness, the cost, and the emotional toll every single second of every day. Not trying to minimize people who are trying to cure cancer, and maybe you didn't mean your comment in the offensive way I took it. Hold the hand of someone you love every day as you watch helplessly while they suffer and tell me it's not a fight just to get through one day.	I think John Mccain is a good guy, but can we stop pretending people with cancer are "putting up a fight?"  It's the physicians and scientists doing the work, and even then so much of it is whether or not the drugs or treatment happened to work.  Cancer is messy and not understood well.  Patients have almost 0 influence over it.	If you don't think that living through that pain is fighting then you obviously don't know what fighting is.    They absolutely **do** have a choice in the matter. Stay and fight the cancer, or give up and off themselves. When you're in that much pain, just making the choice to keep waking up each morning is fighting for your life. 	0
dzvs7zg	Dog attack claims the life of an 8-month-old girl in Miramar, Florida	&gt;what would you have us do, kill all of them? Kill entire species for your own arrogant beliefs?  Nice strawman.  I think breeding animals for our own pleasure is in most cases, unethical, and many dogs/cats aren't cared for adequately.  At a minimum, I think there need to be huge restrictions on adopting pets, much like there is on adopting children.  Many animals are treated like commodities, given as gifts only to be given up and dumped at a humane society to die in a cage or be euthanized.	> In my opinion we shouldn't have pets ever  uhh... can you expand on that? Dogs, and to a lesser extent, cats, evolved alongside us symbiotically. Behaviorally, these are our closest relatives; our ancestral extended family. what would you have us do, kill all of them? Kill entire species for your own arrogant beliefs?	Animals don't have agency.    Here's a solution: don't buy deadly animals and keep them around small children.  It's not that the dog did anything wrong, it's that these kinds of animals shouldn't be taken on by the vast majority of people.  (In my opinion we shouldn't have pets ever, but that's another argument.)	>I think there need to be huge restrictions on adopting pets, much like there is on adopting children. Many animals are treated like commodities, given as gifts only to be given up and dumped at a humane society to die in a cage or be euthanized.  This is a reasonable argument; though I would point out that my comment wasn't a strawman, but an extrapolation.

I am heavy into philosophy; and after much contemplation, I came to the conclusion that taking another beings life so that I could live instead was morally wrong. Ive been vegan for over 2 years now.

e3he3h2	Weekly Hiring Questions Thread - July 30	I failed 6 polys whilst telling the god’s honest truth the entire time and then recently passed a CVSA. Finally approaching the end of backgrounds now. Don’t worry about the prior failures. But if you know poly sucks for you, try finding a dept that does CVSA or one that doesn’t do any of the voodoo machines.	I recently signed a conditional offer of employment with a department I really wanted to work for. I took the polygraph and the psych within one week and patiently waited for my results. I  found out that I did not pass the polygraph (no news on psych, but guess that doesn't even matter now). This is the second polygraph I have failed within a year and it has been at the hand of the same polygraph administrator.  i'm beginning to worry the failures I received from this individual are shedding a negative light on my character with other potential departments. For the record, I have passed a polygraph and a background  investigation with the major city department in my state. These polygraph fails are from the suburban departments I applied to. Do departments view a history of polygraph fails as a negative? I ask because i'm nowhere near finished testing, and have even broadened my hiring process to out of state departments.	None	None	0

Tbh once you've dealt with analog circuit design, the digital stuff feels kinda simple.

Can you imagine if these two didn't die of alcoholism? Can you imagine what a fully Mongol invaded Europe led by Subutai/Batu would've done to European history? Or what the course of Islamic history would've looked like if the Mongol war machine of 1255 led by Hulagu had attacked Mamluk Egypt?

Not my story, but my father retired after 30 years and he always tells this one:  Responded to call of a body in a motel found by a maid. Dead chick wrapped in a shower curtain in a tub. Cold as ice, whiter than white. No pulse. She ded.  Dad goes outside once detectives arrive to securing scene etc.  When he goes back inside the room to speak with one of the detectives, there’s the previously dead chick sitting on the edge of the bed.

e6tvjfd	The trait is high intelligence	So you would have no moral objection to someone farming babies for baby veal...?	1 - Not inflicting any pain on them.  2 - IQ. Babies don't make the cut-off, but killing them would still be immoral, as they're the property of their parents. It's like theft, a TV itself doesn't have any moral value, but because it's owned by someone else, you can't damage it without the owner's permission.  3 - The former.	It's good that you're being consistent, however, I have a few questions. 1. What's a "humane" way of killing someone who doesn't want to die? 2. How do you measure intelligence? IQ? Emotional intelligence? Reasoning ability? Would babies make the cut off? Are you judging a fish by its ability to climb a tree (ie wouldn't any way of "measuring" intelligence  be inherently biased towards humans since it has been created by humans)?  3. Do you really not believe that all humans have a right to live? Or are you just saying it's okay to kill mentally challenged people for food to justify continuing to eat meat?	None	0

e6wwz8p	Question about the conclusion of Name The Trait Argument	intuition is not remotely reliable	>>If you accept there isnt a trait then you should be vegan.  I have a question about this, because I was discussing utilitarianism yesterday. They said that they cannot name first principles from which one can derive the correct action, but just do what intuitively feels right in a specific situation.  I think that this stance makes it pointless to argue about ethics at all, because you can only ever talk about one specific example without regards for anything else.  With this argument, you can also say that you cannot NTT but still eat animals, because you do not have any first principals and it feels like the right thing to do.  Do you see any way to argue against this?	NTT supposes that a person has some objection to granting animals moral value. The wording isn't really as important as the spirit of the argument.  If you accept that there isn't a trait, then you should be vegan.  > on a related note  That's the whole crux of the argument.

e6x5tfu	Question about the conclusion of Name The Trait Argument	That's like saying that understanding higher math problems isn't important because you're unlikely to ever actually use the exact problems that you've practiced.

If somebody says they decide for every example by intuition there is no ‘broad idea’ anymore.  With every other person I would discuss these broad ideas by using specific examples, but the goal is always to discuss broad ideas. If there aren’t any then what is left to discuss if the conclusions will not be applied to the next example.  And that is also the difference to your math example. I will apply what I’ve in one example for the next one, because there is a broad scheme behind it. If you say every example has to be looked at in an isolated way it’s more like asking why would you study history to pass your math exam?	0

e6yi45e	Do people think the likes of Ask Yourself and Vegan Gains are good role models?	I watch AY, not so familiar with VG, and I can't be bothered to watch that clip for any context, so idk why it matters or wtf you're talking about.  But I'm pretty familiar with the vapid question that is 'VEGAN OVERNIGHT THO'.   The problem is that it is an inconsequential hypothetical, while the 'alien' hypothetical is a test for logical consistency.   I can admit that 'VEGAN OVERNIGHT THO' can be bad without losing any ground in my position as veganism. You cannot admit 'alien invasion is good' without losing massive ground in basic human rights. That's the difference.    And the 'VEGAN OVERNIGHT THO' is such an impressively vapid question/platitude that it's not surprising that any vegab would get annoyed by hearing it for the 1,000th time.	At 27 and half minutes into this debate https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUwQ0wRTPqE  VG claims aliens could invade earth.   This is inresponse to his pointing out that the interlocutor is arguing a strawman, despite NTT using exactly the same argument.  Specifically: NTT posits a hypothetical based on eating humans of limited capacity that would never ever happen. Mike is positing a scenario where the world instantly becomes vegan. VG is correct to say that would never happen, but in rejecting the discussion he's being a hypocrit	theyre good	It's not a vapid argument actually. the outcome is still the same. Even if the world doesn't go vegan at the click of a finger, the effect on those working in the industry is the same. At some point the owner of the slaughterhouse will have to close his doors and lay off staff because there will not be enough demand. That isn't a gradual thing; he will stay open until he doesn't - can't, because of conditions. So the question regarding the outcome remain.  Then, if we start eating plants, where are the livestock to maintain soil health and biosphere? What will the machinery run on; oil and pollution? Biofuels? Where do we grow the plants for that?   Your b12 supplements, where do they come from? Where does the plastic come from for the packaging. what is the production process for the pills? What else is put in them and how is it acquired? Is it healthy to consume those additives, things you simply don't need? What about the extra cost in something the demand for which will explode?	0
e6ykodw	Why not campaign for better agriculture?	Ah, so as long as my slaves don't know they're slaves, it's all good.  Great argument!  Also, you demonstrably don't know what an argument from emotion is. I'm literally analogizing OP's post. No emotional appeals. Really great try though!	Argument from emotion.  How does a cow living on grass and eating it, grazing freely know whether or not it's a slave? What is slavery and freedom to a chicken?	edit: I've been banned from this garbage subreddit for this comment chain. Mods are a joke. This subreddit is /r/BePoliteToIdiots cancer  ______________________________________  Why not campaign for better slavery?  First a comment: there will never be a time when the human race, from birth to death, does not enslave humans. It will never happen. There will always be outliers who require cheaper, more efficient, sources of free labor, just as there will always be people who can't abstain from controlling humans for personal gain. My worldview accommodates that;* yours does not. Therefore, there will always be a need for slavery. Wouldn't it be better for abolishonists to spend their time focusing on addressing that rather than all this "all or nothing" "slavery is evil" approach, which hasn't achieved much, given that most slave owners quiet.	Slavery exists between people. HUmans can conceptualise what it means to be a slave and so we understand the experience and empthasise which is why we have banned it.   You can certainly argue people sometimes keep animals and abuse them, that's also wrong. I don't consider killing a cow and eating it abuse because my need for food outweighs.  That's why I said a cow living on grass doesn't know its a slave. If it was 'free' it would be doing exactly the same thing with no conception the farmer intends to kill it.  If you disagree with that, that's entirely your prerogative. Its just preferences.  Cows don't have the same capacity. If i was a vet and I walked into the field with the intention of healing a sick cow, do you think it would understand that? No, it would operate on instinct and flee. 	0

I added an aside that had to do with the exploitative nature of these relationships, and how foreigners are reckless when it comes to polluting African habitats.  Avi chimed in and asked me for evidence that the 'current industrialization of Africa is "worse" (a qualitative term no scientist, anthropologist, or historian would use) than any historical period of industrialization'. Obviously, I don't have such evidence, and even if I did, it wouldn't dis/prove the current exploitative nature of African/foreign relationships.  But he's great at philosophy and at health.

However, the main thing that you've missed, is that these actions had no relations to any atrocities committed by the Nazi government. They were not ideologically driven, being just means to an end of funding the war. Unlike some other cases of expansionism, you cannot even blame it on the economic interests of big business.

e8hp4m6	Few questions about veganism!	Full agreement here. I’m not sure of the most humane way to feed a cat. Perhaps lab meat might solve this problem soon? 	vegan here, cats are obligate carnivores. please dont try to convince others its okay to feed their cats a vegan diet. thats animal abuse.	>  1) What do you think would happen if we set all animals that are used as/for food, clothing, science, medicine, etc.. free?  They would get killed in the wild. In the highly unlikely scenario of everybody becoming vegan over night it is our responsibility to care for these animals until they die a natural death. We created them, they are our responsibility.  >2) If someone has a pet cat, what should they feed it? P.S. cats need meat to survive.  Nothing "needs meat to survive". We need nutrients to survive. Cats and dogs have been shown to be able to survive on a diet that has all the nutrients they require artificially added to a base. However it is my belief that you should not own a cat in the first place.	that’s what i’m hoping. i’ll always feed my cats meat, but i have a very hard time supporting animal agriculture. i look forward to the day that lab grown meat becomes more common and accessible to the point that cat food can be made with it. i do understand the argument that vegans probably shouldn’t have cats because they need meat, but i don’t agree with it. there are so many cats in shelters and on the streets that need adoption and i’d rather take in an animal and have to feed it meat than just let them be stuck in a shitty shelter.	0

e94hk82	CoverGirl is going cruelty-free and will receive the leaping bunny seal from Cruelty-Free International..side note, doesn't mean vegan though.	Arguably eating an animal that died of natural causes is vegan. 	Not necessarily. There's lots of vegan products that aren't cruelty free, like processed foods packed with palm oil or single-serving foods packaged in lots of plastic that ends up harming animals in the ocean.  &#x200B;  There's also a few cruelty free foods that aren't vegan. Arguably bivalves are cruelty free to eat, depending on who you ask, but they're animals. And if you eat some of an animal that died of natural causes in the woods it's not vegan but most people would say there's nothing cruel about it.  &#x200B;  So the two have significant overlap but are distinct.	Seems like cruelty free should have to be vegan by nature you know?  	None	0
e974sok	Is it just me or has the engineering and architectural side of construction gone to shit?	I'm an architect. I see other architects drawings and don't even understand how you guys are building off of them. Like sections that have no dimensions, no callouts, no levels, nothing. It's just a wall with some things that look like floors and roofs and that's it. Like fuck guys, don't even include that if it's not going to even remotely help.   Firms I've always worked in pride themselves on good complete work. That's not to say change orders don't happen, but we spend a lot of time developing the details and all situations.  Now that being said, back in the day from the old timers I talk to, a large complicated building could be done in like 10 architectural sheets total. Because they just didn't worry about a lot of details. It took forever to draw and they figured they would be doing the CA and would make it up there. Likewise the GCs back then filled in a lot of the gaps on assumptions. Then lastly almost everything was standard. There was one way to build a building and you just did the same thing depending on the building type. So you copied those details and boom. Done.  Now with BIM we are expected to do things ultra fast, and ultra accurate. The problem is, even though it does make us faster, it requires us to resolve a lot of annoying connections that someone in AutoCAD could easily ignore or someone drafting could pretend didn't exist.  We are pumping out drawings as fast as possible, and would love to get the time to do everything in great detail, believe you me, I'd LOVE to spend quality timr on one building to fully flush out all of the complicated details and put in the work to resolve every question before it came to me (because 1 hour in CD work is equal to like 2-5 hours of CA work). But unfortunately it's not in the schedule.  I'm under the gun and to add to that, when your consultants drag their feet because they are swamped with work and I don't see structural or MEP until 2 weeks before it's due, and nothing makes sense because no one listened in the conference calls we had. Now nothing is coordinated and looks like we will be issuing a lot of change orders. But this is the timeline that the client wants and this is the way the loan with the bank is set and no one really has wiggle room.  Fuck I'm just rambling now. tldr; us architects hate this too, but it's where we are at. If y'all can find some more time or money in the clients budget to extend our time, I'll be both flabbergasted and estatic.	I had a conversation with the head architect on our project, and he complete agrees design has gone to hell.  Work load and tighter time constraints start the problem.  To make things go faster, younger designers just cut and copy details from project to project without considering the specific implementation on the current project.  The younger designers also don't care if something has to be re-done since it's all digital.      I can't remember the last project I was one where anyone said anything short of "these drawings are terrible".	None	> Like sections that have no dimensions, no callouts, no levels, nothing.  Or worse, bad math. Like if grid A is X meters, and the building is a rectangle, grid G at the other end should be the same length, not 463mm smaller (or any random number). Or 3 or 4 dimensions on top of each other so you can't read any. Or gridlines that aren't real. Hey, try and follow 8A....what, there's no stand off dimension from 8 or 9? But I still have to locate a thing in the middle of the room lining up with your imaginary extra gridline?  I don't want to be petty, but I would have been fired if I had this volume of fuckups per project.	0

Copied from another thread with minor changes for context.  > Workers own the value of their own labor even in capitalism. It's just not worth very much to them personally, which is why they choose to sell it to a capitalist who can amplify it's value and pay much more than would otherwise have been made on their own. This transaction - labor for money - is voluntary and mutually beneficial to both buyer and seller. If workers seized the means of production, they'd go back to their labor being next to worthless again, because they don't have the capital, the knowledge in business, connections, or the risk tolerance to create value.

e9ylzuv	Forbes: Dogs and cats are responsible for a quarter of the greenhouse gas emissions caused by animal agriculture.	If you adopted from a shelter or something then I wouldn’t feel bad about it. Even if you bought the cat there is no perfect vegan. I think being vegan and spreading the idea of compassion and showing that humans don’t need animals to survive and thrive is wonderful and doing your part. I’ve served meat in homeless shelters and felt strange about it but I still did it. I didn’t buy it but I did serve it. I felt horrible but I did it anyways. I try very hard to volunteer for other responsibilities but if it comes up I might do it again.   Keep being awesome and think about it again when this cat passes on. 🌱	This may not be helpful, but as a vegan with a cat, I realize what Im doing is hypocritical and feel guilty about it often.   Im sure theres quite a few other vegans out there like me. I suppose some things could be said in defense of having a non-vegan pet (helping overpopulation, the therapeutic payoff of having said pet, blah blah blah etc) but... at the end of the day I know what Im doing is wrong and hypocritical, and choose to live with that guilt. Its admittedly easier without glass walls around factory farms (as Paul McCartney calls it).   I like what /u/bubblerboy18 commented in this thread:  > I dont have a dog or cat or any pet for this reason. Im sure I would be just as attached to the animal that feeds the cat as I am to the cat if only I knew the animal that would lose its life.	None	None	0
eapfad8	CMV: The prosperity of the west is due to automation, not free market capitalism	I certainly agree. Since neither position can be falsified, I maintain that the most reasonable position to assume is that one cannot currently know whether the reason for the prosperity of the west is due to automation or capitalism. Wouldn't you agree?	I suppose it couldn't, but neither can the alternative. That's part of the problem, history has only happened once!  The best I can think, is that China is prospering while maintaining very strict control over things.	That sounds plausible, but how could your hypothesis be falsified? 	I would agree that you can not *know* in the scientific sense, where you have a statistically significant amount of data, a control group, etc... But you still have to make policy somehow, and the cause of your prosperity is extremely relevant to that. So sitting back and saying it's impossible to really know just doesn't cut it. It would be great if we had that kind of rigorous data to back up our policy, but we just don't. Yet the policy continues to be made.	0
earecrj	CMV: Employers should not be allowed to fire employees over their political views or humorous statements made outside of work.	How do you determine the difference between a joke and a sincere statement of belief?	If it involves someone else in the workplace, it becomes work related and shouldn't be protected.   >"those ni***rs had it good -- us whites saved them from a life of savagery in Africa, ha ha ha"? Would you still consider that to be a "humorous statement" made outside of work?  No matter how distasteful a joke is, it's a joke, regardless of whether or not you or I find it funny.	Can you imagine *any* joke that should ever result in a person being fired? What if the joke ridiculed the personal circumstances of his boss as well as those of every person on his team and everyone in his department and in fact the company as a whole?  Furthermore, what if his joke made light of the suffering experienced by everyone in a certain racial group, e.g. "those ni***rs had it good -- us whites saved them from a life of savagery in Africa, ha ha ha"? Would you still consider that to be a political "view" or "humorous statement" made outside of work?	Ask whoever said it, only they know. It's not relevant here anyway as I don't think either should be a durable offense.	0
eargl9t	CMV: Yoga is beneficial for the mind and body.

Wouldn't you agree that it would be better if schools abandoned practices that have no scientific evidence in favor of those that do?

[Heres](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/yoga/introduction.htm) a link to a site that explains some benefits of yoga, as well as linking to other studies and surveys.   No, I cant personally provide evidence that lives up to the standards of double-blind randomized controlled trials BUT I also cant do that for things like dodgeball or that crazy parachute game where you drag people under, and yet those are practiced in schools.	If any practice is supported by "medical science", wouldn't it be easy to give citations of actual medical science that demonstrate its utility? For example, there are many double-blind randomized controlled trials that demonstrate the effectiveness of a wide variety of medical practices. Can you put forward the same evidence for your practice?	There isn’t ZERO evidence to support yoga. There have been surveys and studies, and you can find a few in the link above.

egp1w9k	Problem of veganism	This is 100% correct. I’ve been vegan since ‘96 and I run 1/2 marathons, ride bikes, and train Jiu Jitsu with no problem. I Still enjoy fake meats but I also eat beans and rice for 3-5 meals a week. I think the restaurant thing depends on where you live. 	Your family is just wrong. You can easily get all the nutrients you need on a vegan diet so long as you do it properly (as with any diet). A vegan diet can also be very cheap, average, or expensive, nothing is forcing you to buy all those expensive mock meats, cheeses, etc.   Speaking from personal experience, the only thing that changed when I went vegan was I ate out far less, learned to cook a lot of different meals, and saved money doing so.  If you want help, there are so many resources you can find online. Id recommend searching around youtube for meal plans/ideas, thats where I started.	None	None	0

It's fine to give the dregs of society a platform if you can effectively counter them, but Maher isn't up to the task of sitting down with the likes of Bannon, Shapiro, Coulter or even Milo, especially when he agrees with them on ridiculous strawmen about liberals. Maher actually believes a lot of the nonsense said about liberals by the right.	I don't really like Maher but zing	His rants about colleges, for one. His rants about millennials, for two. Those are just a couple off the top of my head, but I recall him reciting a few various right-wing talking points on his own on a number of occasions.  That's not to say I don't like Maher. He has views that I disagree with him on, and views that I agree with him on. I don't think I've missed a single episode in the last couple years.

Thinking Islam is bad religion is not the same thing as being bigoted against Muslims as people.  Please, ffs, don't make us retreat this whole Ben Affleck fiasco again.

None	I think it is interesting that posters are responding to Islamophobic part but not the transphobic. Does this mean we all agree Maher dabbles in Transphobia?   Bill Maher has said things like “But. If vast numbers of Muslims across the world believe – and they do - that humans deserve to die for merely holding a different idea or drawing a cartoon or writing a book or eloping with the wrong person, not only does the Muslim world have something in common with Isis. It has too much in common with Isis.”  Saying the "Muslim world" has a lot in common with ISIS is going to far. Seriously, a huge portion of the Muslim world live under the rule of oppressive regimes. Muslims in Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Iraq, etc do not care who draws cartoons. Many of them don't even have access to the news to know anyone drew a cartoon.	0

emu7wzj	Is eating roadkill ethical?	There are going to be so many varying opinions on this. There is no one vegan canon we all adhere to. I think it’s true that eating an animal that was accidentally killed causes no harm to the already dead animal. However, it does help normalize eating animals which I’d like to see diminish, if not go away completely. However, if eating the roadkill prevents further killing (whether it be from a hunter or slaughter house) then I’d say roadkill is the better option. There is a fair amount of nuance and angles to this subject.	Does this change if you were the one to hit it instead of someone else? And that part was actually a response to a comment someone made on my other post claiming it was disrespectful to the animal. Where I live deer get hit all the time and often someone from local government will come pick up the carcasses and either throw them in an incinerator or dump them somewhere remote, which seems a little inconsiderate if you really care about how that animals life is honored.	This question comes up a lot and the answer is always unanimous. Yes, roadkill is fine so long as you haven't run it over deliberately so you can eat it. It's probably not very safe and it's definitely not very appealing to most of us, but from an ethical perspective you can't harm an animal that is already dead so there is no issue there.  Edit: by the same token, there's no logic in your claim that you eating the animal is somehow more "respectful" than leaving it to be eaten by other animals. Not sure where that idea came from but it doesn't make any sense.	None	0

epwfb9p	What was your 'I don't get paid enough for this' moment at work?	YOU were immature?! I can think of nothing more immature than timing bathroom breaks. You do that to schoolchildren, not working adults. A lot of the time productivity comes from creativity and initiative so the "do as I say, no questions asked" attitude is also counterproductive. I'm a graduate teaching assistant at a University and I basically run the department I work in, my boss is extremely hands-off which has given me the space to fix things up around the place and improve productivity without someone constantly breathing down my neck, questioning all my decisions.	Oh man, I'm actually relieved, because I had to do this same shit to my subordinates, and honestly I made up numbers 99% of the time because they worked their full hours and could prove it, and their performance was the best in the office because they weren't being crushed by an asshole dictator.   I left after I was told to follow my subordinates to the bathroom to time their breaks in there, and one of my team was a pregnant woman. When I objected, I was told by the highest management that I was immature, not a team player, and I had to do exactly everything I was told, no questions asked. No exaggeration, those are direct quotes.  I made sure my folks were covered and handed in my resignation.  After I left, my friends there told me that a bunch of other people walked too. It was a great place to work for my first two years, but the manager had never held that position, was stubborn, and hated millennials, and so went out of her way to be horrible to her own staff.   No ragerts, yo.	My boss insisted that everybody be at their desks at 8:30 sharp. She made me take roll on an attendance sheet and hand it into her everyday. She also made me do it at lunch time (when everybody left and came back) and when they left at night.  Took roll for a bunch of adults three times a day. I don't work there anymore.	Oh yes, and I was so surprised, I said (a bit more scoffy than I wanted), "EXCUSE ME?!" Because that just blew my mind.   Apparently, I was immature because I questioned the great leader's management tactics, and I reported that morale was incredibly low with multiple people threatening to leave or already actively looking elsewhere. Ya know, where their manager doesn't stand outside the bathroom with a stopwatch? That sort of thing?   The highest higher-ups said it was because productivity had fallen, and I explained it was because of the micromanaging and the insane amount of redundant paperwork the great leader was forcing people to fill out. Again - I'm super immature and should thusly just go fuck right off. Which I did, and it was great.	0
epxfpct	Saw this on Twitter and had to share since I haven’t seen it here yet.	We do approach the problem from different angles. Just saying I don’t care is not a good argument or justification for anything. If you’re laughing out loud at animals being killed you’re likely a psychopath or an edgelord, and I’m betting on the latter.	When that cow got hit I laughed out loud.  I love sausage and I know how its made.  For me what does it is the environmental impact information.  The more Ive learned about that the less meat I eat in general, especially beef.  I know yall think Im a monster but you wont change how people like I feel about animals.  If you want to make a difference approach the problem from different angles.	 Sometimes I think it’s hopeless. Because people don’t want to watch this kind of videos, don’t want to see what has to happen for them to eat meat, or even just an egg.	Is it you’re either Patric Bateman or Eric Cartman?  Being desensitized to it and laughing at the funny face it made isn’t an option?

This is an amazing ad, imagine if the TV networks were to pick it up and play it, I'm in Australia so it wouldn't happen here but I like to live in hope.  Like a few others here, I've been vegan for about a year now.  How do you guys deal with being ridiculed for your choices? For example, I was at work yesterday and a I heard one coworker say to another coworker 'she doesn't even eat meat' while discussing my healthy eating habits, it was in a belittling manner. I know I'm doing the right thing, I have never felt better about any choices I've made in life, I will never eat meat or animal products again. Just curious if this happens to you and how you deal with it?	I like them...	0
epxgtxx	Saw this on Twitter and had to share since I haven’t seen it here yet.	Hiding from the truth in these videos is trashy. Yes it is gore I agree. It’s also reality. You quite literally fund it every time you buy your eggs and milk. Now that’s trashy.	And I'll still buy meat, milk and eggs at the store anyway. Trying to scare people with gore videos is just trashy.	None	Noone is hiding we know where it comes from we simply don't feel the same way you do about it. Why don't we show videos of children getting slaughtered by drone strikes at the cash register your taxes are funding that everytime you buy anything we don't do it because it would be dumb as fuck just like this video.	0
epxh1ti	Saw this on Twitter and had to share since I haven’t seen it here yet.	Dogs are omnivorous and can thrive on a vegan diet..... careful who you call a dumb fuck you might end up with egg on your face!	Thank you so much for being a rational, pleasant member of the vegetarian/vegan side of the debate, as a content carnivore I really struggle to not have a knee jerk reaction towards your group bc so many push their wishes, which I dont give a shit what they eat, onto everyone else and not just preach/teach, but actively shame like this video does. By the way, the videos of meat and cheese definitely do not work, my stomach and mind are in a consensus that they are yum and good for me.   One thing which does disgust me about veganism and vegetarianism is those who force it onto pets (dogs and cats are carnivores for you dumb fucks who do this) and children (let your child choose for themself just like you should with religion and gender and whatnot), honestly ruins the rest of the movement for me	Just to bring to light some positivity -  the number of vegans worldwide is rising by precentage. More and better substitutes are made and more non-vegans are switching over.   On another, more Serious note:  Showing meat and cheese/egg eaters grotesque imagery may work very rarely (if you are here, you are more empathetic towards animals than most probably). I believe that shaming people into eating vegan is not the right way, it is more likely to scare them away the same way evangelists scare agnostics to atheism.  I am a vegetarian. I am still looking into the best substitutes for me and my lifestyle. It is hard, don't try to deny it.   Seeing Advice for recipes and substitues here helps ALOT! Being shamed for eating eggs? not so much.  So please, stay optimistic and not preaching and shameing. Live y'all ❤️ keep on making the world a better place	“Can thrive on a vegan diet” mhmm totally dogs definitely aren’t preferentially carnivores with meat as the core part of their diet wolves are just weird inbred dogs of course   Do you think any dog *wants* to not eat meat? Of course not. And what do you think guides their tastes - hint, it has to do with evolution	0
epxhe73	Saw this on Twitter and had to share since I haven’t seen it here yet.	Animals are not moral actors as humans are. Animals also rape, murder and fling poo at each other but I don’t see you saying that’s all good. Why not? If animals can fling poo I see nothing wrong with humans doing it! Amiright?	I dont like the whole guilting the customer tone of this commercial either. I think being vegan is good if you can do it, but telling people they are shitty for eating meat isnt cool.   Animals eat other animals in the wild. I see nothing wrong with humans eating animals to live. I do think we are excessive as the meat industry has strong grips on public opinions and as a whole people should eat less meat in general but I dont think eating meat is a sin or anything. I	Im not a vegan. Honestly I think this video would be more effective if the cashier didn't have such a look of disdain. Just reinforces the stereotype that vegans are smug holier than thou people.	Then why are you defending the lives of rapists, murders, and poo flingers so adamantly then?	0

er4hnnd	Billie Eilish going off on Insta	It’s not a difficult concept. You can argue that one person going vegan makes no difference, I disagree completely but that’s fine.

You want to tell me 500k people abstaining from animal products doesn’t reduce demand at all, or encourage the production of new vegan products? You’d be wrong.	i want more evidence than just "one person adds up" she is way too vague	None	None	0
er5967g	Which movie villain would be considered a hero in a different film?	So just straight up what Batman says in BvS	Yup. There's a fanfic ("The Metropolitan Man", if I recall correctly) where Luthor goes into this in more detail. If there's something which cannot be stopped, it doesn't matter how infinitesimal the probability of it turning on humanity is - the probability multiplied by the potential loss is still too much to sit back and do nothing.	Lex Luthor.  There are a bunch of different versions of Luther over the last sixty years or so. Most are cartoonish, moustache-twirling villain archetypes, while some are more dignified and compelling. But the core of his argument has always been that you can’t trust someone with near-infinite power to always have your best interests at heart.  It really only was through an incredibly unlikely turn of luck that Kal-El landed by a farm with Ma and Pa Kent. Imagine if he’d turned up in Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, or in Taliban-held Afghanistan? What if he had a really, really bad day and just snapped? (Note: watch “Brightburn” for an idea of how bad things can get when you’ve got crazy superpowers and no moral compass.)  Luthor was an egotistical millionaire and was very clearly a villain, but with Superman he’s not wrong. If Kal-El ever decided humanity was the problem, he could just flat-out end us.	Batman quote when he say he has a way to stop and defeat every member of the justice league and that if they dont do the same for him they are idiot. Loved that.	0
eriycq1	To my coworker once again...	Absolutely. I dislike them both, too, but I at least respect the guy who calls himself an asshole more than the guy who tries to disguise his assholery as some sort of virtue.	Am I allowed to dislike both?	Usually guys who are assholes don't call themselves assholes. They tend to refer to themselves as *politically incorrect straight talkers* who *call it like they see it* and *don't sugarcoat things, hold back, or pull punches*.  Which is pretty ironic if you think about it for more than two seconds. I have more respect for the Denis Learys of the world who say "I'm an asshole and I'm proud of it" than I do for all the armchair culture warriors who say "fuck the PC libtards, I'm a truth warrior and I tell it like it is."

evxibhw	Twitter users are escaping online hate by switching profiles to Germany, where Nazism is illegal	Twitter promotes toxic behavior just by its fundamental structure. It exposes your tweets to complete strangers. If these strangers agree with your views, they can press a little heart icon. If they don't agree, their only way to express that is to comment.  That system actively promotes idiodic comments from people who have nothing at stake,while mitigating supportive comments. Couple that with Twitter's refusal to act on anything outside of an extremely narrow definition of harassment, and you have a platform that rivals Facebook in abrasive user generated content.	I opened my Twitter account in 2007, not long after it launched, I'm proud to say I closed it this past week, what an absolute waste of energy it's become. At this point it's populated almost entirely by crazies; no matter which side you take on an issue you get crucified by a weirdly committed group of idiots.	Or just GTFO of Twitter entirely...	None	0

What gets me the most about the whole thing is Hannity trying to make Obama sound all elite and fancy and out of touch for wanting dijon mustard. Dijon mustard isn't even fancy or special or anything. It's like $2 a jar.	The mustard thing really drives me crazy because he was at a deli. He wasn't at some persons house calling them trash when they didn't have his preferred condiment, they're supposed to have that stuff.

eyu0610	My problem with digital downloads, am I overthinking?	No movie is perfect. And you can support it with remote participation. Do you pay taxes? Does a small part of your taxes go to support abortion and/or birth control? Then you have remote participation in abortion, which again is not wrong.	Of course, but thats for the description of what happened, not for the sake of blasphemy. Youre not supposed to support it.  In the case of media like movies in games, they blaspheme as an interjection	You might have scrupulosity.  You did nothing wrong here. Your participation was very remote, and that does not mean very little sin, but none at all. Even Jesus participated in remote sin by encouraging people to pay taxes to Rome, which were then used for killing people in crucifixions, in gladiatorial games, etc. Remote cooperation with sin is not sinful in and of itself unless you do it for a malicious reason, which you obviously did not. I probably have explained myself poorly, here, but the bottom line is that you have nothing to fear and have done nothing wrong.  By the way, the Bible contains blasphemies like "We have no king but Caesar" and it is not a sin to download the Bible. Heck, Catholics say that very line every Palm Sunday at Mass.	I know the concepts of remote and immediate cooperation, what I've been worrying about was the whole fact that these digital copies are created by me.  If you buy a movie or show from the store, you don't create a copy of the blasphemy, it exists anyway, and you're not responsible for it.  I would think if you download it, you create a copy, you essentially create a copy of the blasphemy too.	0

True but I think only the best westerns have gone down as classics, looking at some of Sergio Leone's work and its still fantasic, it borrows heavily from some earlier Italian Neo-Realism. Westerns were also sme of the first to popularise the anti-hero like Clint Eastwood in Fist Full of dollars, and hell look at its infulence on modern tv and cinema, Tony Sopranos's "whatever happened to gary cooper, the strong silent type".  Westerns have had a huge culutral infulence over the years, but these superhero/marvel films dont seem to have anything, they are not groundbreaking, they are not pushing the limits of film in a theoretical sense. Its just generic pop culture	In 50 years I wonder if they're going to be remembered as anything more than a cultural phenomenon. People compare them to the overabundance of Westerns a while ago, but many westerns have gone down as classics of cinema. Will we see cape flicks topping the 2072 Sight & Sound poll?

And the only time we discuss details are when you're just like trading stories.  But girls tend to like immediately report on things to their friends, and share details that honestly could be embarrassing or uncomfortable for the guy. It makes me really uncomfortable and creeped out to think that if I sleep with a girls I have to just accept that all of her friends are going to know every detail about the experience.

God forbid we prioritise characters and character arcs over tedious lore obsession./s	Meanwhile, the sequel trilogy makes absolutely no sense politically or militarily.  Not that Star Wars is alone in this. This sub-80 IQ writing fad of focusing entirely on character drama over actual plot development isn't doing the industry any favors.	None	High-IQ people and wise people focus on things. Low-IQ people and impulsive people focus on people.  If you create strong, creative plotlines and a consistent world, the characters will actually have meaningful connections to the world, which will improve the characters themselves that much more. Intelligent people can widen their view of the world enough to understand this.  If you create character drama for the sake of short-term dopamine hits, without grounding it in an immersive world and plot that makes sense, the film doesn't hold up as a creative and interesting work of art.  It's a matter of declining IQ in the population coupled with a reduction in shared culture/heritage.  More impulsive, unintelligent people with no connection to their past results in entertainment media needing to provide short-term dopamine hits while you're in the theater instead of longer-term rewards that come from reflecting on the content afterwards.  Though in the case of The Last Jedi, they didn't even manage that. The throne room fight scene was abysmally slow, the overall light saber combat choreography was terrible in the sequels so far, and even the character drama made absolutely no sense (the infamous Rose + Finn scene on the salt flat).  But this is what happens when society shifts from meritocracy to everyone getting participation prizes. All aspects of a film suffer as a result. Plot, dialogue, choreography, pacing, humor, everything.  Because people with high time preference and lack of emotional control are doing the writing, the directing, and everything else that goes into the final product. For another blatant example of this see: the CW comic-based TV shows (Arrow, The Flash, etc.).	0

The balance between genocide and no genocide should not be half of a genocide. The similarly the balance between gay civil rights and no gay civil rights should not be some civil rights, it should be gay civil rights.	As a gay, it sounds fine and fair to me. It's about balance, and not everyone feels the same way. Too bad this totally organic sub forgets that all people don't think or behave the same way.	That isn’t true though. Gays can be fired, evicted, and discriminated against just for being gay. Gays still can’t give blood like straights can. LGBT still have issues with bathrooms, military, and hospital care.   So was it imbalanced to give African American civil rights? The middle between equality and oppression is still oppression.	0
fca30bg	Question about Confession	Yes, let's assume that this was done and no sin was found because they thought it not a sin.  Most people in the South prior to the Civil War did not think that slavery was evil.	A regular examination of consciousness is important to allow the Holy Spirit to enter us and shine a light on our sins that would otherwise go unknown.	None	You mean “invincible ignorance”?  TBH, I’m less concerned with the historic sin that might not have been recognized at the tone but are obvious in retrospect then I am with the sins I’m blind to now.   What about our everyday life will people look back on with condemnation?  Has the Holy Spirit stirred my moral conscience but I shoved it aside because the idea of change seemed to hard or outrageous? Had a rich salve owner thought about freeing them all and living a “simple life” only to push it aside as outrageous? What would their judgment be like; to know that was God they ignored, how much pain and suffering they could have avoided?  It can’t be less then crushing.  When I’m confronted with the full magnitude of my sins, both known and unknown, will I fall on Gods mercy or will I run away in shame, self exiled to hell?	0
fca3wci	Question about Confession	&gt;If a person does all he can to develop a well-formed conscience  But clearly in these examples that is not the case at all.  &gt;Do you think a sentence of life in prison is intrinsically evil? That's  an even worse condition than slavery it would seem to me. You have no  freedom and are stuck in a cage all day with nowhere to go.  Are you defending slavery here by favorably comparing it to something far more normal? I specifically said not to. Honestly, how can you see slavery as smaller sin than by putting someone in prison for life? I think it is heavily implied that to get a sentence of life in prison you must do something very bad indeed, like murder or serial rape.	"Delicta quis intelligit, ab occultis meis munda me."  We asked to be forgiven of sins that are hidden from us because of our blindness. If a person does all he can to develop a well-formed conscience and has done an honest examination of conscience and confesses all known mortal sins with true contrition, either imperfect or perfect, then his sins are forgiven through the sacrament of penance.  &#x200B;  Do you think a sentence of life in prison is intrinsically evil? That's an even worse condition than slavery it would seem to me. You have no freedom and are stuck in a cage all day with nowhere to go.	None	Ok, then the person is guilty because they have neglected to properly form their conscience.  Oh you said not to, so I need to do whatever you tell me? Lol	0
fca660r	Question about Confession	Thank you for your thoughtful reply. I have a followup question if you don't mind.  Why do you assume this only ignorance, whether factual or moral? A person must know that deep down this is truly horrific. In the Cinderella example, and with many, if not most people who physically and emotionally abuse children, they will justify and rationalize this abuse, but the term "ignorance" seems only to capture a small part of the problem. "Hardness of heart" seems much better.	Someone who acts out of genuine ignorance doesn't sin mortally by definition, so it doesn't need to be confessed. This could be factual ignorance, such as not knowing something we buy is the result of slave labor, or moral ignorance, such as not knowing about some specific moral obligation. I think for most slave owners in the antebellum south it was probably a mix of factual and moral error.   Most people have this idea that venial sin isn't a big deal, but this question should illustrate why that's not the case. Attachment to sins of which we are ignorant impedes plenary indulgences. It continues to infect our lives and distort our souls regardless of the sincerity of our repentance. This is why we must always be trying to form our consciences well and always trying to be open to the movement of the Holy Spirit in our lives.	None	Hardness of heart is perhaps a more poetic, and thus more satisfying, way to put it, but I think ignorance is more precise. What we're talking about is a failure to understand, whether it's a failure to understand the moral quality of our actions, a failure to understand the consequences, a failure to understand the circumstances, and above all a failure to appreciate the moral value of another human being.   Call it hardness of heart, that's not wrong and it's good rhetoric, but I think on the technical level what we're talking about is a lack of understanding, a failure to know, and thus a kind of ignorance.	0
fcabnls	Question about Confession	Thank you for this reply. This makes a lot of sense.  Okay, so now let me mention a real-world case. There is this parish where the people are filled with so much pride that they are one of the few parishes to be truly Catholic, and they *just know* they are so good because they go to Confession every week or two while regular Catholics might go only once a year or once every few months. They frequently speak down of regular Catholics, the 99%+ that aren't similar to them.  But, while I am not eavesdropping on their Confessions, it doesn't appear like anyone notices this insane pridefulness. So I very much doubt most people are confessing this. Indeed, the priests encourage it. It is implied that this parish is one of the very few that will restore civilization and fix the Church, etc., etc.  Then there's more. The pastor was removed by the bishop for sexually abusing multiple people (not me), and nearly the entire parish has rallied around him, and in at least one case that I saw, blamed the victims. While I don't know 100% what happened, I highly suspect the priest is guilty, and further I highly suspect many others knew, because again, this was not one victim.  It's all so troubling me about the entire Sacrament. It's like what is the point of going to Confession frequently if it's like this?	I think that the most likely cause here is one of the following:  A selfish wilful ignorance in which one lies to oneself about it in order not to have to change.  I, myself, am well acquainted with this phenomenon.  #OR  A sort of emotional disturbance that prevents one from being able to honestly analyze the matter.  In the former case, I would say one is culpable.  In the latter case, I would say one's culpability is reduced.  It is likely that these would often exist in combination, and then I suppose it really comes down to the genuine intent and desire of the person to be aligned to God's will first, or his own will first.  Getting into these technicalities can make it easy for us to rationalise away our own sins, so while deep and searching questions are good, do not forget to accompany them with honesty, and with constant vigilance.	None	Well the thing is about the sacrament itself, that if it's not done with the proper disposition, it isn't valid.  The point is that it's guaranteed to us by Christ through the authority of His Church, which is unaffected by the personal holiness of a priest, and that whatever anyone else may be doing, and whether they may be guilty of presuming God's mercy or abusing the sacrament, it's still the sacrament for those that do avail themselves of it properly.  That's surely one of the reasons that Christ made it a matter of authority, and didn't say "the most faithful among you can forgive sins."  All the things you said are deeply troubling.   And those words sound trite because they're overused, but what else is one to say?   I could write a book and not come close to expressing my horror at the use of clerical position to prey on others.  But I digress, really.  That's all a giant mess, and people do that stuff for all kinds of messed up reasons.  Some consciously, some not.  I don't think anyone would blame you for going to a different parish.  Then there is also the desire (good in my view) of many to stay and be the one saying the emperor has no clothes.  Remember that the Church may be in the hands of fallen, fallible men, but that it does not rely on them and they cannot make it no longer what it is, hard as they might try.	0
fcawn8k	Question about Confession	Thank you for informing me of this. I don't mean imprisonment. I mean slavery by the commonly accepted definition. Let's use the 13th Amendment in the United States for example, as Federal courts interpret it, except let's even ignore indentured servitude for now, even though that is prohibited in the 13th Amendment too, and just focus on slavery.	So on the topic of slavery, and there not being anything intrinsically wrong with it, the issue there is definition of terms.  The reason that there isn't a blanket ban on "slavery" is because it has been used to refer to multiple concepts throughout history.   Imprisonment is a form of slavery, technically, under most definitions, for example.	None	That's chattel slavery, and it's intrinsically immoral because it violates the dignity of the human person.  But what is called slavery in the bible is something else.  Indentured servitude and chattel slavery aren't immoral.  Indentured servitude is not intrinsically immoral; it's a legitimate way of repaying a debt.  In recent centuries it was used abdusively by creating the debts artificially or unfairly, and/or undervaluing the labour, and generally being abusive labourers.	0

Just saying something happened does not mean that it happened.	So agree that he should provide testimony and documents to support his claim?  But this is a bit ironic coming from a Trump supporter. Making claims without proof is what he spends a good 90% of his time doing haha. Hell he makes a lot of claims with information disproving them. AKA lies.

There are no leagues. People aren't supposed to automatically pair up with their looksmatch. People aren't trying to pair up with their looksmatch.

fpdfthy	If your insane ideology hates voluntary exchanges maybe you are wrong?	Coercion is contradictory to the definition of voluntarism.	Why? You're forbidden to say no?	We see it like this: the world is dominated by billionaires who swoop in and hog the resources people need to live so they can exploit the workers’ labor.  A “voluntary exchange” in such an extremely imbalanced power dynamic can never truly be considered voluntary.  The left has a different idea of “voluntary”. Basically, it’s that people who have everything they need can be counted on to contribute to the good of everyone with no promise of reward. Look at Wikipedia. An entire website, accessible to anyone, with access to the combined knowledge of centuries. And no one pays or gains a single cent for it. Just people, creating goods for the sake of creating something good for everyone. That, if you ask me, is true volunteerism.	But by this definition the whole life isn't voluntary cause you still have to make physical work to eat and drink and you can't choose not to do so without dying, so you can't never achieve a voluntary society by this definition, thus it's a retarded definition	0

fvayxxo	"The Biggest Killer in the Black Community is Fatherlessness" - Discussion with Denzel Washington	Some of them, absolutely.  I would say the rise of white nationalist groups is largely due in part because white communities aren’t allowed to celebrate white achievements without it being ‘racist’.  I’m not saying we need to keep statues of known slavers and historical racists, but when you tear down the only sense of identity a community has without putting something positive in its place, you leave a power vacuum that nefarious parties are happy to fill.	Are "white" issues due to a lack off "white leaders"?	I’m not black, so I have no real perspective on this. But as an outsider, it really seems like “the black community” has a number of systemic issues which plague it and yet few to no “black leaders” which stand up to address them.  What causes fatherlessness in black communities? Is it cowardice of the men not ready to be fathers? Is it arrogance of the women who insist “I don’t need no man”? Does our welfare system incentivize single motherhood? Is black involvement in crime so prevalent that many black dads are locked up or dead?  I’m not trying to be insensitive, these are genuine questions I simply don’t hear people talking about.   Part of me fears we’ve already become too polarized about racial issues to even have these discussions. Which is a damn shame, because this is really an American problem rather than a racial problem, IMO.	None	0

Example, I changed the one thresh for another Nautilus in deep deck, but I didn't needed at the end 3 Nautilus, 2 ere fine and the shadow island that sticks better with that deck after maokai is thresh, so I stocked it again.	The short version: Some people derive satisfaction from winning with their own creations and/or off meta decks (aka winning with style), while others prioritize winning however possible (netdecks, p2w options), and the last group are people who like to win with big spells and creatures.  We all care about these 3 aspects of winning, but everyone's priorities are different.

I made a Vlad deck myself a month ago, but the iterative process of coming up with a deck that works is too much. By the end of it, you just end up with a deck very very very close to a popular one.

fy0stdx	If Vegans weren't so crazy/cringy then maybe Veganism might be more accepted and normalized	This is pretty bad rationale.  To support animal welfare yet not be against it happening is a very odd stance to take, akin to an apologist.  To support Black Lives Matter, yet not scold others for systematic abuse against them.  To support anti-rape campaigns, but not scold someone else for raping.  When there is a victim 'I just stay quiet' is an injustice.	People have seriously said that to you? I'm vegan but it's my choice for my own reasons and I don't tell anyone else to do it.	None	I am against it and I don't stay quiet. But I also don't push my beliefs on others with force or rudeness. You catch more bees with honey than Vinegar.	0
fy0sx7b	If Vegans weren't so crazy/cringy then maybe Veganism might be more accepted and normalized	You forgetting that there's a victim when choosing to eating meat? It's not just personal opinion.  'Mind your own business' doesn't help society evolve or stop injustice.	Not in those exact words, but most recently someone very condescendingly told me "I should be embarrassed for eating meat in 2020." Um What? I scoffed and told her to mind her own business. Her eyes nearly fell off how hard they rolled. We were at CAVA. For those who don't know it's an uppety Mediterranean chain similar to Chipotle but with bomb-ass salad bowls.

fy0t9ch	Veganism Mega Thread	Sure, as long as we can agree that BLM protestors shouldn't force their opinion onto others.  See the contradiction?  A animal based diet has intentional victims. It's not just personal preference. If it was victimless, sure, I'd agree with you - vegans should stfu. However, there are victims. So people should fight for peace (as they do for BLM).  It's a contradiction to be against animal cruelty yet eat them.  Asking people fighting for animal welfare to be quiet shows the privilege of the person that clearly doesn't care more about animal welfare more than being mildly uncomfortable for having their actions questioned. I'm sure police that are brutal to minorities also want BLM protestors to be quiet too.	Can we all just agree that vegans who force their ideas on others or who have to make a constant point to others about their veganism suck.	None	This is a ridiculous comparison. Humans are more important to humans than animals. This is an objective fact, as psychology points to the reality that organisms naturally value their species over the species of others, in an attempt to ensure the prosperity of their species. Valuing humans over animals is a natural occurrence, as it should be.  Furthermore, some people *need* to eat meat. Their bodies can't sustain vegan diets. No one needs to be racist, and no cop needs to kill an innocent black man that was posing no threat. It is most definitely logical for BLM to push their ideologies, because the innocent lives of human beings are at stake. Vegans on the other hand, are dicks, because they are too privileged to realize that not everyone can sustain a vegan diet. Whether it be health concerns, geographical positioning, socioeconomic status or other struggles, there are tons of reason why many human beings cannot sustain a healthy vegan diet. It's a shame that animals are dying, but at the end of the day, some people don't have the privilege or the capacity to do anything about it. The fact that you throw the "privilege" card around, while claiming that being vegan only causes "uncomfortability" in people shows just how ignorant you are to reality.	0
fycz8dv	If you're promoting your amazing diet to me, you better bring along bloodwork and not just "I feel fantastic" etc	You believe personal preference is better than meta analyses for determining the value of a diet?	Id say personal preference trumps anything else when it comes to choosing a diet. In a sense, trying one out is like a mini self-experiment. Do I feel better going vegan, is keto worth the hype, etc. Youll get people advocating both for and against any given diet, so the only way youll know for sure if one works for you personally is to try it out.  That being said, I cant stand the type of person who feels its their responsibility to convert me to their diet or something. Im happy to temporarily try going vegan, but let me do so on my own terms.	None	Doing your own homework is more important than trusting what statistics and studies on their own IMO. So no, I don’t support a diet that’s crazy high in trans fats or processed sugars, for example.

fzspney	[Shitpost] Real images of psychiatrists running a code.	I second this.  I view a "psych code" as me telling the nurses and BHSs what to do (without actually saying anything, because they usually know what to do).    \*Cue film noir music\*  I arrive dramatically on the scene and locate the charge nurse.  Oops, she's involved in the restraint and getting spat on.  Find the most official-looking person not doing that.    "What's the situation?"  I get the situation.  Let's have a look.  Patient shouting but restrained, no thanks to me.     Mentally assume credit anyway to boost self-esteem.  Time to cross my arms.  Stroke beard to look sagely.  Realize I shaved this morning and I'm just caressing my own skin.  State out loud various factors that are influencing my decision to treat the agitation with this neuroleptic or that benzodiazepine to sound sophisticated, even though I know I'm probably just dialing up an order of Haldol + Ativan.  Maybe I could reach for the Zyprexa or Thorazine if I want him to just take a nap, but then we should hold off on the Ativan for fear of excessive sedation and---  Too much thinking.  Haldol it is.  Glove up and grab the syringe.  Except don't because I don't even do that.  Watch as the med nurse executes my command.  Just like those real-time strategy games I used to play when I had a life, before the grueling 45 hour work weeks of a psych residency stole it from me.  Smirk at my own sarcasm.  Oh right, patient.  They're calmer now.  Still upset but calm.  Good enough.  Let's debrief so I can get back to ~~playing video games on call~~ re-reading my psychopharm text.  "What's wrong?"

fzu7hkx	[Shitpost] Real images of psychiatrists running a code.	One reason I stick around this subreddit is to encourage medical students who think they aren't good enough to actually be doctors.  I'm going to suspect that PGY-1 psychiatrists and PGY-1 internists start out on pretty similarly shaky footing when it comes to running codes.  We don't really do formal "crash codes" in psychiatry since if someone codes in a psych hospital, our goal is mainly protecting ABCs while we call for EMS.  That said, we do face plenty of acute situations in our field.  Trust me when I say this: you'll learn to stare down those situations, sphincter fully intact.  Residency will make sure of that; doing it every day, learning and growing every day, will make sure of that.  This comes from someone who 5 years ago thought there was no way in hell he could learn how to be an actual practicing physician without someone holding his hand.  Just keep a mind that's open to learn (especially from mistakes), and you'll get there.	This came about after a pulm/cc doc told a story of him teaching psychiatrists to run codes.

Autonomy day was awesome if you're interested in autonomy. They built an amazing computer and people barely understand that effort.  Battery day will be awesome if you're a battery nerd.

But u/110110 might be able to elaborate some more :)	I think they will not only unveil the Plaid Model S, I think they will introduce a refreshed base Model S that uses the same body as the new Plaid variant. I think the changes to the body of the car to accommodate the new battery and second rear motor will be extensive enough to require a redesign.   It won't make sense to build 2 separate Model S bodies so with the introduction of Plaid will come the introduction of Project Palladium (refreshed Model S).  I also think we'll see a Ludicrous 100 kWh Model 3 but maybe for a different day.	None	Couldn’t it be announced and shown but not available until next year?

It says it right there on the page.   Obviously a journalist (or even a careful reader) you are not.	I dont think theres a consultant issue here, these are journalists and this is a greenwashing article for one of their biggest automotive advertising customers.

Agreed, but current performance can't be used to predict future performance (given the large architecture change).   Additionally, we're assuming it will be based off only on image recognition, while it could absolutely have a location label as well.

This comment is a great example of reading comprehension failure.	Great, roundabouts in a year. Now weve got a timeframe, by the time autopilot 6 comes out itll probably work. I think this admission alone really reveals that FSD as a permissibly functional tool isnt happening anytime soon. Roundabouts are in no way edge cases on roads, they are super common and I drive around them daily. Ive lost faith in FSD being properly functional (vs feature complete) happening with HW3.	None	No, this is a great example of reading between the lines, based off past Elonisms. Your post is a great example of blind optimism. I guess if you’re on of those suckers who paid for FSD In 2016 and are still hoping for it to be released by the end of 2017, it’s a mindset you have to adopt.	0
g1mqufz	First 2 Tesla model Y registered at Dutch DMV.. Red and Blue!	&gt; If supply &gt; demand in the US then they’re likely to start exports sooner  If there was any indication that was the case, then they wouldn't be working to add a new Model Y line at Giga Austin. So it seems unlikely that will happen.	Not necessarily. If supply > demand in the US then theyre likely to start exports sooner rather than throttling down production. Considering the US COVID-19 clusterfuck, this isnt entirely unlikely.   Giga Berlin is still a while away from starting production, and its not unlikely that initial model Y volume will come from the US.	Cool, but we'll have to wait for GF Berlin to finish before seeing them in Europe	Increased capacity will increase supply. Tesla is thinking long-term anyway, but exporting vehicles could be a solution to a _possible_ short-term dip in demand.	0

g24c9ii	(Capitalists) How do you plan to deal with climate change.	For the record, “Decrease the amount of arable land” and “destabilize food supplies” is just a way of saying people and animals will die and starve and it’s not a big deal. You also are playing fast and loose with your definitions of “extinction level event”, are you only considering that humans will go extinct or species that we depend on for food? What about that arable land? If it’s grasslands or the plains then we have significantly less land for crops, less food for animal husbandry and live stock and ultimately extinction of species.	For the record, it wont kill literally everyone. It will destabilize food supplies and decrease the amount of arable land, but its not an extinction level event.	None	It will be very bad.

g2cmtm3	Man dies in Arizona after being restrained by police on hot tarmac for six minutes	The problem is that police keep suffocating people. I feel like a method of restraint that requires pressing your body weight down on a person's windpipe is likely to end in a person's death more often than some other method. At the very least, police should be aware of the amount of force they're using on a person and responsive to stuff like the person saying they can't breathe, or literally going unconscious.	Police do need better ways to restrain people.  Although I wouldn't be surprised if one time in a million, regardless of what method they used, their suspect ended up dying.  And this is what we're reading about now. Police around the country probably performed a restraining action a million times in total within the last 12 months and it caused several deaths, including this one.	If being restrained by police regularly results in death maybe police need better ways of restraining people.  Oh wait, silly me, that would mean the police wouldn't have the authority to extrajudicially murder people anymore.	I dunno, I can't think of any restraining method where after 12 months and hundreds of thousands or several million restraining actions, not a single one was carried out wrong or on the wrong person and none resulted in death.  There are only so many ways you can safely restrain a large, strong man without messing it up one time in a million.	0

Plus also, plenty of women get called "so called" if they're not into kids and childrearing, whether they're trans or not - he may not even have known she was trans. Unless she mentioned it specifically to him, obvs. So it was probably just a regular ol' misogynistic comment haha. And yeah, sure, no one has an actual *obligation* to watch their roommate's kid, but holy shit, have a teeny bit of compassion!	Am I the only one who thinks ESH?   It’s a kid, not a demon. The only problem you listed was him messing up the microwave, which, fair. The transphobic comment was out of order but you said he looked distraught? It was a family emergency, I don’t think he was looking for child care? Just he was desperate. I mean, I feel like this is one of those reddit situations where yes, you’re objectively in the right, but don’t you have a bit of empathy at all? An MMO is an online game, right? Couldn’t you play it still while just keeping an eye on the kid in your room?	>Therefore he gets a pass. This is your argument  No one said he got a pass. Stop being obtuse.

g2r0q3t	Elon: "400 Wh/kg probably 3 to 4 years out"	&gt; that puts us at 350 Wh/kg measured capacity.

Also having a hard time finding where the current "advertised" value is in any of Tesla's marketing material. Could you point me towards it?	This prediction is completely in line with industry projected growth of 5% year over year.  If we know that cells from 2016 tested at 237 Wh/kg, and we add 5% per year from then until 2024 that puts us at 350 Wh/kg measured capacity. That easily puts us at 375-400 Wh/kg advertised.	None	Tesla doesn't advertise it. So your option is to take the energy value from the CAN bus and divide by the number of cells, or actually perform a cycle test on a few cells.  350Wh is not far short, given the fact that the value for a cell's capacity is a maximum and each cell varies quite a bit.

In my state, and a ton of other places, you're required to stop for a yellow light so the intersection can clear before it turns red.   You treat a yellow light like a red, not a warning to speed up so you don't have to sit at a red.	None	My personal favorite is when I'm in the intersection waiting to turn left, the light turns yellow, then some dickhead who could've stopped decides to blow through the light so I'm stuck in the intersection when it's red.  This happened to me last month. Not only did the asshole running the yellow flip me off like I was cutting him off, the people going on green honked at me while I cleared the intersection like it was my fault they were inconvenience for an extra second on their commute home.	0

Listen, I get it, what she did was nonsensical, but your reaction was totally extreme. You guys are SIBLINGS, and she's obviously in a rough spot, so she makes one mistake, says ONE thing, and you kick her out? Come on man.

YTA  You seem a lot more capable and intelligent than your sister whos both immature and either emotionally or intellectually handicapped. Instead of being indignant and angry you might have recognized that her delusions of how things work and what she deserves is pitiably scrambled. Another redditor wisely suggested you could have shown her an itemized bill for food, water, electricity, and the going rate for rent in that neighborhood to wake her up to all shes getting.  Your sister has no reason to feel proud of herself and Is likely fronting every whiff of confidence and contentment she flexes on you. You could have handled it with the calm upper hand of a person n solid control of their life, but you leapt right to How dare you! Hey out!  You were kind to take her in, but youre delusional if you expected her to suddenly become a responsible go-getter. Which kinda makes you TA.	None	Look, you can get off on “righteous” anger or you can recognize others’ limits/handicaps where they can’t.   You can’t do both at once.  If big brother understood that she’s overvaluing her financial contributions because her ego is shattered she’s got no prospects for actually being valued by the world and making real money he wouldn’t have been offended and could have applied some magnanimous mercy on the kid without being taken advantage of.  The burden of wisdom is restraint over those rash emotional impulses. You younger guys may not grasp that yet and imagine swift retribution is the goal at any perceived wrong, but as you get older you’ll realize you bought yourself nothing more with it than a fleeting rush that you “take no shit from nobody” while not achieving any real insight into the situation that approaches is wisdom.  Most folks in the world are over emotional brats. OP’s sister is one but so is OP. Maturity is the ability and interest to fathom where the other person is coming from more than flexing the full scale of your own hurt feelings and power.   If any of you are having trouble maintaining close intimate relationships then you might reflect on how quick you are to anger. It’ll fuck you up for life if you don’t get on to of it.  —A middle aged dude who’s fucked up plenty	0

In a similar vein, it’s just like how it’s “judicial activism” and “legislating from the bench” when the court rules in a way you don’t like, but it’s “upholding the constitution” when they rule in a favorable way.	The problem is that "identity politics" is only a label that people use to describe *other people* when you don't like what they're doing. Under a loose definition of identity politics, nearly every group constantly engages in some form of identity politics. But everyone would say "No, I'm just voting in line with my personal interests." The difference between doing that and engaging in "identity politics" seems to be nothing more than whether you like the result or not.	None	None	0
g3u8lr8	CMV: Male circumcision on non-consenting individuals should be illegal and criminally charged as battery/mutilation.	That’s just what you think.  Your penis is likely less sensitive than it should be, and sex isn’t nearly as pleasurable as it could be.	25 years old and ive had zero effects from being circumcised. Yea its kind of a weird thing but i dont think its an issue like everyone on here makes it seem to be.	None	My nuts are nice and ive never noticed anything with the stimulation. Some times im super sensitive other times not. But i always attributed that with lile how in the mood i am yada yada.	0
g3utzjd	CMV: Conservatives are not “oppressed” or “under attack” in the US	That isn’t oppression. Political views are a choice.  If a person expresses evil views, It’s not oppression to be labeled evil and for others around you to think that you’re evil and regard you accordingly.	Do you believe people should be judged by your perception of their demographic or at an individual level?  [The CATO institute conducted a poll that shows that those with right leaning opinions are less likely to share their views.](https://www.cato.org/publications/survey-reports/poll-62-americans-say-they-have-political-views-theyre-afraid-share#liberals-are-divided-political-expression)  The only group that feels comfortable sharing their views are "Strong Liberals".  So that statements that you're hearing are a result of that. As well as biased views from web forums, like Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube. On Reddit alone, moderators routinely ban people from forums for even disputing leftist views.	None	So you just misunderstand what is even being discussed.  You also seem to take the view that a conservative view is inherently evil and thus deserving of being censored and squelched. I mean, that’s a violation of a fundamental American right, you don’t see an issue with that at all?	0
g3z661p	CMV: Supporting abortion by arguing body autonomy while also arguing for mandatory vaccinations is hypocritical	No, it is not. Certainly not to point where it has rights that trump those of the woman carrying it.  No person is entitled to another person’s body. So I’m not sure why so many people want to grant *extra* rights to a fetus.	you say an embryo is not a person, which is usually up to 8 weeks of development.  what about a fetus?  is a fetus a person?	Abortions aren’t contagious.  Abortions only affect one person, the person who consents to the abortion.  And no, an embryo is not a person.  Infections diseases are contagious, and a selfish person who refuses to get vaccinated can end up infecting other people.	you seem to be contradicting yourself a bit there.  if a fetus is not a person, then why is it necessary for you to make your second statement that no person is entitled to another person’s body?  and if the second statement is true, why is it necessary for you to claim that a fetus (which includes 8 month old fetuses fully developed and physiologically identical to a born baby) is NOT a person?	0
g4p8szi	What was your "Damn I'm old" moment?	Not me, but I witnessed this moment.  I was born in 1999, but was young for my grade in HS.

I heard some younger kids I worked with talk about how they wondered what it was like to live through 9/11. I mentioned that I was alive during the attack and they asked me to tell my story. Like I was a WWII or Vietnam vet. It hit me that I was apart of a completely different generation.	None	None	0

g7187yo	Bros, how do I deal with the fact that people might be scared of me?	Men are commonly, for lack of a better word, indoctrinated as boys to be responsible for girl’s comfort and safety.  Feminism has attempted to tear down the fabric of a healthy society without understanding why it was there in the first place. Men and women need each other to fulfill certain roles and needs that is difficult to handle alone. Once they solidified the “strong, independent woman” trope, they were set up for failure.  Besides the utter detachment from reality and latent sexism at the core of such an idea, the feminist fairy tale of the women “who don’t need no man” never bothered to prop up an analog for boys to look up to. Women are now “empowered” to go out and live life by themselves, while men are still expected to be providers for women. Patriarchy my ass.  Maybe someday a generation of parents will love their children enough to say this is horseshit and stand up for boys as much as they do for girls. But I’m not holding my breath for enlightenment in my lifetime.	I  don't understand why so many men feel like it's their problems what women feel, even though they have done nothing to create the situation... like, fucking stop apologizing for existing... stand up for yourself and make them take responsibility for their own feelings.

The issue people have is with the use of alt accounts in your own raffles. Nobody cares that you might lose a fiver on a raffle, people do however care if you win a main raffle because that means youre just raking in cash without giving anything up.   Nobody knows whether your stories about coworkers and friends using these accounts is true. From an outside perspective it looks like youre sacrificing a small amount of money to be able to double your money. You can hopefully see how this would be frowned upon.  Either way, hope you and u/purplick are doing well. It doesnt seem like the same raffle without yall. Never won anything from u/no_poet i don't think so don't even have that to fall back on lmao	0
g78tkzh	20 reasons I think Trump is more pro-MRA than Biden	I’m an anti feminist third; I’m an egalitarian first and MRA second. The virus response and our border control problem (ICE camps, etc) are an unmitigated disaster which are directly resulting in death and suffering. Climate change is a global issue which a republican controlled US simply isn’t willing to participate in. By those measures, I will choose a democratic candidate over a republican candidate. If they happen to be a feminist, so be it.  The misinformation that feminism spreads is a cancer on society at large, but you can live a surprisingly long life with cancer. Feminism’s presence isn’t the biggest issue at stake in this election.  As for the country being on fire, that’s both rhetorical and literal. The west coast was basically ablaze for a few weeks and to my knowledge, the administration did  fuck all about it. Which is largely what happened regarding the race riots and BLM protests as well, a cowardly nonresponse and hiding from the public.  I think intersectionality is horseshit. It’s feminism coopting race theory to raise women into a virtual minority status while continuing to erase individuals from complicated conversations where there are no clear cut privileges. It distracts from the classism problems the country suffers from, while encouraging benevolent racism of treating people differently due to their ethnic background. It’s a weird, shitty social version of affirmative action, which is little more than a white guilt cash-in scheme.  Reddit, microcosm of modern America and its tech savvy international friends, has a tremendous chubby for virtue signaling. IMO, BLM accomplished nothing and never will accomplish anything of merit because it lacks coherent leadership and organization. Honestly, a more reflective patriot would recognize that Obama did little to nothing for race relations in the US, and that the nationwide protests about BLM should have been about police brutality in general and not caught up in race, but these are problems inherited from generations of missteps and inaction on a federal level. The media, social and otherwise, are largely responsible for stoking the fires of ignorance around such topics.   Biden isn’t the leader this country needs, but Trump has already tried and failed spectacularly. The evidence is plain. Supporting a routine failure and threat to national security reeks of the same arrogant ignorance that fuels flat-earthers and anti-vaxxers. There’s mountains of science and reason working against them, but they refuse to see logic. At some point, you have to concede that it’s not just a mental deficiency, but there is a certain level of psychosis involved.	Interesting. So to be clear, you're an antifeminist, who is willing to vote for a feminist, because of climate change, and the pandemic response. Am I understanding you?  You mentioned that the country is on fire. Do you mean the race riots? What's your opinion on those? What do you think of intersectionalism?	I agree that Biden is not the MRA candidate, however, the laundry list of Trump’s failings and embarrassments regarding general human rights, the virus response, and climate change...  I cannot in good conscience ever vote for a person as selfish, sightless, and corrupt as that. They do not in any way represent me or my interests, even if he’s done a thing or two I agree with.  Trump is a dangerous embarrassment for democracy and the United States suffers for his crimes and inaction every day he’s in office. Biden is a feminist bore, but at least the guy isn’t pretending the country isn’t on fire. I put very little faith in the DNC, but they’re the only major party willing to acknowledge America isn’t “great” right now.	Funnily enough, I'd be happy to vote for an even tougher and more Nationalist version of Trump. So yeah, I hear your criticisms loud and clear, and I don't take any offense to you shitting on Trump. lol.  Glad you cleared some stuff up. I worry a bit about Global Warming. I believe in it, but I'm willing to compromise on it.  Because unlike you, I believe that intersectionality, feminism, social Marxism, whatever you want to call it, is an existential threat, and has the potential to annihilate us.  Hyperbolic it may sound, but it's true. The central conceit of the Marxists, is that meritocracy IS the problem. Not that misapplication of a meritocracy can have problems. They reject the idea that a meritocracy can even exist at all, because nobody is better than anyone else, and consequently no idea is better than any other.  You find that affirmed over and over again in all aspects of their worldview. Bourgeois managerial class people aren't deserving of their status, they're merely lucky to have inherited their privilege. Nobody is allowed to speak their mind and judge ideas on their own merit. The most marginalized person must be put on top of the priority list because it's just. They will literally tell you that representation is more important than competence.  They will navel gaze and wax philosophically about moral relativism, cultural constructs, and personal lived experiences. They will waste all their energy critiquing tradition, but are fundamentally incapable of making a value judgment on what is good, and how to be prosperous.  Instead they fetishize ideas like, 'pride', 'acceptance', 'tolerance', and 'individualism'. Okay, it's good to be proud of yourself. But what should you do feel pride? Nothing, you can do whatever you want and just be proud. What should we tolerate? Whatever. It's not on us to decide what's right or wrong. What should we do with our individualistic asses? Whatever you want to do. It doesn't matter.  It's insidious, because it makes life seem so easy. You're free to be your best self without any of the encumbrances and obligations of a crusty society to hold you back. Except being your best self isn't something that comes out of freedom. It takes commitment. It takes effort and it takes discipline. So the whole idea falls apart on itself.  Liberalism isn't a value set. That's its fundamental flaw. They have nothing to say about who we should be and what we should strive for.  So the question you could ask the Democrats: What do you stand for? And maybe they could say Ecological Preservation or something, and maybe there's a grain of truth to that. Press x to doubt. But mostly what they're about is destroying meritocracy. The are committed to their goal of getting women and minorities in power... And that's where their plan stops. They have no idea what they would do afterwards. Because all they can do is destroy not build.  You know a really good rebuttal to the Feminist proposition is, "What inherent part of the feminine essence do you think is the key to improving (arbitrary social failing)?" Lol. See if they fall into your trap.	0
g7oy14o	100% vegan cheese and charcuterie board I made! Went over extremely well in a room of mostly non-vegans.	Not to overhype store-bought vegan cheese (since it always pales in comparison to restaurant-made or homemade), but I would argue that most non-vegans **haven't even tried a fair variety of vegan cheese**, rather than "most don't like it".	Wow that's awesome because most non vegans don't like vegan cheese so I hope the stores start to get more vegan cheese like the ones in your picture since the omnis like them.	None	None	0

g7raiyj	Since there's already a ribbon showing on 100%-completed games in your library, Steam should officially give players a Ribbon for every 100%-completed game, so that players can showcase them on their profile and compare Ribbons with friends.	&gt;The problem is it wouldn't really be that special  They aren't special now, regardless. Somebody's busywork checklist doesn't improve a game, it just provides more hooks for dopamine release.

One only has to read these comments, begging for meaning in the meaningless, to see the truth of it.	Having a gamerscore attached to achievements would honestly be awesome.	yeah, before moving forward to making achievements better and make them actually mean something, steam should find a way to prevent others from using sam picker to easily unlock every achievement with the touch of a button. The entire achievement system badly needs a rework to match something that of PSN where they actually contribute to your profile. rn you can't even feature more than 7 achievement on your profile at once so even though I have 30+ 100% games I can only showcase 7 achievement which says I've gotten every achievement / the rarest achievement in that game. Even if it doesn't increase your steam level like it should, there should be a complimentary showcase to everyone that shows your achievement progress.	But I'm honest when I say that Valve should add more features to achievements somehow...	0

g8advyl	So Sega just trashed the posters for all their games in the Steam library	Easy to fix? You expect someone to take the time to find images and replace them one by one for every game they own? It's not like there's a toggle switch somewhere.	It's temporary to celebrate their 60th anniversary. Plus you can change it to whatever you want and it won't be overwritten. I've never seen such unwarranted whining over something so easy to fix.	I'm fine with this on the store front.. change up your sales pitch artwork fine.. but my library is my space and you've overreached.  When people are already starting to get annoyed with publishers making unwarranted changes or overreaching the bounds of what is something I've purchased with what is something I've leased this isn't the right way to do marketing.  [https://imgur.com/gallery/3T3z4uz](https://imgur.com/gallery/3T3z4uz) \- vomit  It's like when the publisher changes the book art of a kindle book you bought and replaced it with something that no longer represents the book you bought and the book you love.. it's annoying and crosses the line between the 'subscriber agreement' and makes me want to vomit.

g8tk2b9	If you want an example of the "skintight undersuit for armor" trope done right, look no further than Halo	To be fair, the initial Zero Suit designs didn't have the heels. I don't think it's a stretch to think that they'll be reverted to flats later on.	Exactly. The Zero Suit is cool in concept, it just looks dumb and unnecessary when Samus has massive boobs and dumb out of place heels. The standard zero suit almost looks like skintight pajamas.	None	i believe the heels were added by Sakurai to make her kicks easier to read in Smash, since she mostly fight like that. Hence why they are so big and have extremely flashy colors.  This is a similar design philosophy to Street Fighter, which gives its characters big, exaggerated body features to make them more readable during gameplay.  Edit: I stand corrected, they're from Other M.	0
g8tkjwo	If you want an example of the "skintight undersuit for armor" trope done right, look no further than Halo	It's not that bad IMO.

g8x761l	If you want an example of the "skintight undersuit for armor" trope done right, look no further than Halo	No one's saying that the leotard/sports bra look should be the undersuit. The Zero Suit is just more objectified than the other outfits, and showing less skin isn't the story here.	Yeah, I don't get the arguement that it's less practical to wear beneath the armour compared to the leotard/underwear/bikini from before. Bare skin against armour is NOT a good idea.	IDK about you, but if i were going to wear a big suit of armor, i wouldn't want to just pop in in my undies, and given that the armor shifts so much into morph ball mode, some kinda loose clothing would probably get snagged into stuff.   If we assume that the suit would work for samus if she were in it naked, i'd assume the zero suit is for her comfort while using the suit. Tightly fit so it doesn't need to be adjusted while using, and probably absorbs sweat and prevents rubbing against the metal or chafing when it's hot or jumping through lava.  As far as color goes, i mean she's not military, so there's no uniform, so i imagine she just picked out a color she liked. The zero suit makes sense to me.	IDK, I've seen people say that they'd be "more practical" than the Zero Suit, or that it somehow makes more sense for her to wear that under the suit compared to the Zero Suit.	0
g8x7khg	If you want an example of the "skintight undersuit for armor" trope done right, look no further than Halo	That's kind of the issue, is it not? The Zero Suit is *meant* to be glossy eye candy, while the MJOLNIR skinsuit is designed to be a simple undersuit.	Yeah sure, the left picture looks more realistic. But how often do you play in that Skinsuit? Is that suit a signature icon for the Halo series in any way? It looks quite generic, and that's not what the makers of Metroid wanted for Samus. In general, Metroid gives less of a damn about realism. Same thing with the interface for her power suit: she can toggle that thing on or off whenever she wants, it just disappears in a flash of energy. Do you ever have a scene in Halo where a Spartan takes their whole armor off and it takes about 5 minutes? That'd be boring.  Also, at first I was irritated that this picture of Samus looked kinda bad and yeah, her suit and hair look way too bright. But that's because she has a terrible black background in her picture, while on the left we have a very complementary light one. Samus would look way better here if she just had a stark white background, so that's misleading.	None	Samus is a unique character and therefore has a visible and striking design even when outside of her power armor. That's a good reason for it to look like it does. If you say that an armor undersuit has to look realistic, intricate and not flashy, then that's your taste, not a truth of character design.	0
g8z2pdc	If you want an example of the "skintight undersuit for armor" trope done right, look no further than Halo	Funny you say that, since they have given Tony a skintight undersuit too, and THAT still looks a hell of a lot better than the tacky Zero Suit.	This is like trying to compare the Power Suit to Iron Man's suit. You just can't.	None	Tony's skintight suit was literally Under Armour.	0

They aren't trying to win an election.”  No, they are just trying to get nominated to certain positions to advance their career/power, so branding is still important to them.  And to get nominated, one often has to have it known how they stand on certain issues to be in line with the agenda of the nominating party.	Why would Judges care about about branding? They aren't trying to win an election. Also being an Originalist doesn't necessarily make you more conservative. Gorsuch an originalist, for example, is somewhat less conservative than Kavanaugh who does not identify as such.

gaer59u	CMV: A candidate for Presidency should have served in one of either: mayor of a major city, US Senator, or Governor.	With regards to Eisenhower, he was Supreme Allied Commander during WW2 and was then military governor of occupied Europe.  Both of these roles involved a lot of politics and governing as well.  So to say that he held no political office is not entirely accurate.	Why did you exclude House Representatives from the list?  Agree or disagree with her politics, I think most would agree that Nancy Pelosi has more government experience than a first term Senator does.  Moreover, what about generals?  Eisenhower held no other political office that I can recall, yet was by all accounts a very effective POTUS.  Similarly, Taylor, Hoover and Grant held no elected office prior to becoming President.

Not my style but the craftsmanship looks spot on.	gotcha, yes i call them drafters if not licensed. my daughter just had a house built in Texas and the builders have an architect not licensed on board. i guess i associate not licensed as not professional and therefor lacking a greater understanding of their profession. based on what i have seen, there is no comparison to the level of information on building drawings from my area N Y to the drawings presented to them in Texas. the plans were lacking so much so that I re-drew the plans in chief architect so i could go over every detail with them until they were satisfied.  i mean the original house plan didn't even have a wall section detail ?  i guess im biased since where i am from their is a higher standard for building.

gcn9lz1	CMV: We need to offer college debt forgiveness - but on the condition that if you accept it, you surrender your degree.	So you think having a “surrendered” degree magically makes you forget what you learned and didn’t go through the actions of completing the degree?	I've heard the opinion from hiring managers that a college degree is important because it shows you can stick to a goal. This is why sometimes a degree will get you a job, even if your field of study wasn't specifically related to the job.  For those hiring managers, a surrendered degree would negate this benefit. But if you stick to your commitment to pay off the degree, you keep all the benefits. Win win!	No employer is going to care whatsoever about someone's degree being "surrendered." It's not like they currently demand to know how much student debt you carry when you apply for a position.	Not at all, and that's not my intention. I just think that this would be a good way to offer relief to people who need it while still encouraging people to pay the debts they committed to if they can.	0
gcn9tzr	CMV: We need to offer college debt forgiveness - but on the condition that if you accept it, you surrender your degree.	Your premise is based on this false right wing trope that the only people struggling with student debt are people with “bullshit” degrees.	It's based on whether your specific degree is financially benefitting you. If it's not, you cancel it and wipe your debt. Sounds like a good deal to me, if I was stuck with a money pit of a degree.	Why are we gatekeeping the "good" jobs from people based on wealth and income? It sounds like you are just trying to reinforced class structure instead of actually giving people a path to upward mobility.  Are you really suggesting we let people go through all the education prove themselves capable then take away the piece of paper then society use to filter out the 'worthy' from the 'unworthy' because they didn't have enough money to pay for college at 18 or don't want to spend years of their life in debt? So can go back to being the little people they were always destined to be? This is pretty discussing.	Not at all, times are tough right now for a lot of people, and I know that there are plenty of people who are struggling through no fault of there own in general. I don't look down on people with insurmountable college debts... that's like the most honorable form of debt a person can have.  But I also don't think we should disincentivize people who can pay off their own debts from doing so. This seems like a good middle-ground to me.	0
gd1sg2w	6,000th Achievement! (Only took 17 years)	But not enough self-respect to avoid wasting time on busywork checklists?	Even though I'm hard on myself and make self-deprecating jokes (ALL THE TIME), I have more self-respect for myself than to use SAM.	or 1 day with SAM.	"Time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time."      I didn't open up the game and go "Okay, what achievements do I need to get?"  I opened up a game, played it, and as a result of that got achievements.  I have over 900 games in my library but only 28 games I got 100% on.   So yeah, I didn't really waste time on busywork checklists.  I enjoyed a hobby and happened to acquire a significant amount of checklist fulfillment as a result.	0
gd5ngci	True Shit!	The law seems unjust because there are many Indias within India. For a majority of Indians, women, whether educated or not, are seen as breeding machines, home servants, and caretakers. And the unofficial social contract to adhere to those ideals is so strict that anyone straying away from those ideals is punished for life.	Divorce laws in India are in stark contrast & totally women oriented. Wife's social & financial status plays no role whatsoever e.g. Husband needs to pay alimony even if she is educated but doesn't have a job. If they have a child, things get worse. There needs to be a balance.	None	None	0

gd65bkg	[Twitter] "Latinx" sighting at Steam	It's the imposition of western values (neutral terms) on a culture with different values (gendered terms).  You don't get the outrage because you don't care about actually being respectful to other cultures that differ to you, and it's a terminal issue with the ideas of what is and isn't cultural appropriation, along with the ideas of how it happens. [While this image is to do with the larger topic of colonisation, it's still very much applicable here in that what woke people doing is they are not just superimposing western values and suppressing the originals, but they are actively looking to replace the original values with their western values.](https://64.media.tumblr.com/c728713f1df8083d3228e7d3f2cc938a/1ab42c3a4c0be39b-ed/s640x960/743546382d4d8119c331e98a35348b0fa530781f.jpg) ]  Basically, this is actual and proper cultural appropriation, where they take an aspect of one culture and try to replace it with an aspect of their own, all while maintaining the most superficial aspects possible, and I can't decide whether it's Orwellian or Huxleyan when you think about it, but I'm leaning to the latter as they keep their superficial bullshit around to minimise opposition as much as possible.

Helpful hint : Latino doesnt mean male. Its not gendered.	I dont really get the outrage. Its just to refer to either male or female right? since they sound a like apart from the last letter.

ghzoko7	Arguments against pet breeding	You don’t *need* a pet, though. The vegan choice in your case is to not have a pet. Buying from a breeder is not ethical, and it’s definitely not vegan.	I dont want to be a contrarian here because I agree with the points being made. However I have a severe allergy to dander which cannot be managed adequately with medication. The only way I could have a pet besides a fish would be a dog of the so-called hypoallergenic breeds.

ghzond3	Arguments against pet breeding	You’re not vegan if you’re buying from a breeder.	Ive been vegan over 10 years and Ive worked in the pet industry for ever. I have 4 rescues. All pure bred dogs of breeds that I like. 2 Russian wolfhounds, a rough collie and a papillon. I have no qualm with breeders who do genetic testing and research and have requirements for adoptions. I will go through a trusted breeder for my next Russian wolfhound because I want to train it for specific things. The two wolf hounds I have now are from meat markets and I will never be able to make them the therapy dogs I had anticipated for. So I guess what I am saying is Im pro rescuing but if you want to go through a breeder make sure its a responsible breeder.

gi1z9mv	Generation Z and the Covid pandemic: 'I’m 100% more politicised'	You can easily phrase that many ways, it probably still has the same meaning.	Just a caveat, having worked with journos a lot, unless you see someone say it, always ask yourself if a quote has been rewritten. Does it sound like the voice of the journo based on their other articles? Quite often they paraphrase quotes.  For example, original quote could have been Im not sure if I trust what they say anymore and it is rewritten to be harder hitting and clearer. Always keep an open mind with newspapers folks.	From the 11 year old:  >Covid has changed me in a way that I deal with my worries better now. I used to be quite worried sometimes but lockdown has taught me not to worry. I’m not really sure how it’s taught me that. I think I have grown up a bit.  >“I’m not sure the vaccine will help as much as people say. Everyone thought the pandemic would be over by Christmas and they were wrong, so they could be wrong again. **I have become more unsure about what people in authority say.**  Bold from me	Found a journo! Haha, joking aside, that’s the grey they operate within. But there are ways of saying things that also give a different message. From lack of surety to an absolute belief can give a different message.	0
gi2150k	Generation Z and the Covid pandemic: 'I’m 100% more politicised'	Rubbish, people at my work expected it to be done by September or so, that lockdowns would eradicate it.	> Everyone thought the pandemic would be over by Christmas and they were wrong, so they could be wrong again.  I know this is from an 11 year old but this is a lie.  In March 2020 most scientist said this will be long term event.  That there would be a second wave in the autumn/winter and that a vaccine would not be available till 2021.  This is essentially exactly how things panned out.  So it is not about the knowledge it is more how people (politicians and the media) twist the facts to their own desires and are happy to lie.

After a weird symptom that I guess they're only recently starting to associate with Crohn's (one part of my lower lip swelled) they did an invasive test and found some slight inflammation.  My doctor said it may have been hard to detect at the beginning because my vegan diet has been keeping my inflammation down. :) She said not to change my diet when we discussed my treatment plan.

gibhlq8	Forget F1 engine freeze and bring back V8s, says Bernie - Motor Sport Magazine	When cylinders get larger, it gets harder to run engines at high RPM.  As cylinders get smaller, you have more relative losses from internal friction (also more parts to fail).  So there's a sweet spot/range for cylinder sizes, around 300-500cc depending on application and other factors (race cylinders tend to be smaller and more square than in regular cars for higher RPM).  So if you assume a race engine is already running at it's limits for rpm and compression, you can add power by either adding cylinders or adding a turbo/supercharger.	Is there an expert in engines who can ELI5 the difference between V6s, V8s and V12s apart from the sound?    Edit: and the amount of cylinders obviously	None	None	0

He will be jailed until trial. With organic food, an individual cell, double blankets, and a teddy bear shaped like Donald trump, for comfort.   That should teach him a lesson.   Just to be clear I think having prisoners in good conditions is the best idea. Trying to punish them through their food or living spaces is just torture disguised as justice.   But it fucking angers me that this guy gets to even be heard about his bullshit diet, and all the immigrants who didn't have food or blankets, or the Muslims who are fed ham deliberately, yknow, all the others who ARE punished through their food and living spaces, are not heard because "well, we cannot cater to their specific needs, they should've thought of that before they came here"	None	Yeah, the anger is against the system.

cdml8gh	[Not SRS] SJW for RockPaperShotgun gets shut down trying to preach "empowering female design" to Blizzard game director.	Well it shouldn't really surprise anyone that it's a double standard.   Also, the fact that what people generally aspire to be (in terms of looks) is what is most attractive to the opposite sex kind of makes both true.   Even if female characters are "male fantasy" because that's what guys want to look at... then it's also "female fantasy" because that is what girls want to look like.    On that same note, male characters are easily "female fantasy" just as much as "male fantasy" for the very same reasons.   Girls are attracted to X, and guys want to be X so girls can be attracted to them.   	Tying into that, I hate the argument of "male characters are made to look like the male fantasy, and female characters are made to look like the *male* fantasy as well." Not that I even disagree with the notion, but give me a fuckin break -- maybe *you* wouldn't want bigger tits, a nicer ass, a skinnier body, and a hotter face, but like 99.9% of other women would *definitely* prefer that, for the most part.   I mean hey, maybe some of us here wouldn't want to look like Channing Tatum (the *female* fantasy), but given a choice between our current bodies and his, we'd *all* prefer to have his (unless someone here is already a famous model/actor). He's just generally attractive.   In other words, I feel like most feminists who bash that sort of thing are just lying through their teeth about what's "attractive" just so they can support their shitty arguments. 	Ugh, those last three questions tainted what was an otherwise decent interview. Any person who feels that uncomfortable around exaggerated or embellished character designs should stay away from gaming entirely.  But seriously, just look at picture used at the top. All I see are two mutant characters, and three male characters with exaggerated physical characteristics. This is no better or worse than the portrayal of female characters in some games. The only difference is intelligent gamers don't bitch about petty trash like that.	Late reply here, but yeah, that's basically what I was getting at. The "male fantasy" for male videogame characters is only a "male fantasy" in the *first place* because it's what females want to see. And vice versa.   People can just be "generally" attractive, and are recognized as such. Some SJWs look at some female character who has a huge ass and say "I would *never* want an ass that big!" Which may very well be true -- but would they *prefer* that ass to the ass they currently have in real life? You can bet your ass they would.	0

clbc0bs	Here's How Insane Inequality Has Become in the U.S., in One Stunning Chart	Unfortunately you are downvoted for the truth. The world just can't support all the fucking idiots we keep placing on it. 	>  Sounds like wealth inequality makes a lot of sense and the economy isn't a big shell game.   Sounds like society just doesn't need so many low-skill people. /r/overpopulation.	I'm looking forward to the the day when people complain about something other than this nonissue.  Over the past few decades:  * We have seen massive changes in development and globalization.  This means 1) there are more developed nations that will have high demand for goods and 2) it is generally cheaper to produce things  * Incredible growth in tech.  You can create create a lot of value with very few employees and low operating costs.  Take one look at silicon valley.  * It is very easy to reinvest wealth and the fed funds rate has fallen to 0% so aggressive investment is necessary to get good returns   So demand has grown, production costs have dropped, businesses are less dependent on maintaining a big staff in order to bring in massive revenue, and reinvestment is pretty much a requirement in order to avoid inflation.  Sounds like wealth inequality makes a lot of sense and the economy isn't a big shell game. 	None	0

cqoc5ji	Quick question	I will disagree on the scouting front, at least in comparison with the previous regime. The converse of Guenin and Stuart is Everberg and Rendulic, who were brought in only after the Avs placed a greater emphasis on finding non-NA players. We saw how that worked out, and another DEL player is due to sign as a result.   The flaw is less about scouting and more about Roy's overall philosophy about getting bigger (and meaner) like the Kings. The ideal combination is size + skill. Guenin and Stuart have the former, but someone with both assets (e.g. Erik Johnson) is rare. I understand Roy's logic about acquiring Caron; it's to open up space for Duchene and Iginla (like Mitchell successfully did). But when you have Caron and Hishon, I wish the Avs would prioritise someone with talent over someone who happens to be tall.	Hard to tell since the new management has only been in place for such a short time, but there are early signs of some major flaws in their professional scouting philosophy (exemplified by Guenin and Stuart) 	None	I don't see what those guys do to excuse a clearly flawed scouting philosophy about experience, size, and character. The teams moves at an NHL level have all focused on those attributes (Briere, Iginla, Stuart, Guenin, Sarich) and all those players, save one, were big time disappointments. That reflects poor professional scouting, which is currently overvaluing veteran experience and character and undervaluing talent. 	0
cqolnyz	Avalanche Plan on Signing O'Reilly to a Long Term extension this off season	Good thing they had him this year then. /s	I hate to say it but if ROR walks it will probably set us back about 4 years I wouldn't be shocked if we never made the playoffs again in the SakRoy era without him.

cvj1eqf	Question about Ciri	If you see Ciri as a damsel in distress you've not beeing paying attention. In fact you would do well to read the books.	Haven't read the books either but here goes:  Ciri is Geralt's adopted daughter. Due to their relationship with Geralt, Triss and Yen also know Ciri. The emperor is Ciris real father and the druid I think knows Geralt from before? Can't remember that detail.  Either way she's just universally important to everyone ever in the game and this gets annoyingly clear as you get further and further. Why she's running is explained in the game so I won't spoil that for you.  As a non-book reader it gets quite annoying how the game pushes you to feel bound to Ciri and Yen when in reality they mean nothing to me. All I knew about Yen was that she was Geralts girlfriend before Triss, and after 1 & 2 it's not like I'm just gonna ignore Triss because Yen's back now apparently. As for Ciri well she never really meant anything to me. She's just the damsel in distress of the main story for me.	None	None	0

Considering they said they'll be supporting The Witcher 3 for two years following its release, and the fact that they said Blood & Wine is scheduled to be released in the first half of next year, that will leave a full year of support left.   I imagine they'll either make a third big expansion of a massively enhanced edition which deals with a lot of the issues people have with the base game (third act, Wild Hunt, etc.).	None	0
cwljtx8	If you could create your own witcher school what animal would you chose and what would you specialize in?	The so-called 'Koala' witchers are shrouded in mystery. Although no reliable written records of this school are extant, rumours persist amongst the peasant-folk of unusually short witchers luring their prey beneath trees, before dropping from above and dispatching these unsuspecting foes with a rapid flurry of blows to the face and neck. According to legend, a modification of the trial of the grasses causes stunted growth in members of this school of witchers, greatly aiding their ability to conceal themselves amongst branches. An unintended side effect of this modification grants Koala witchers a perpetually lethargic demeanour. This has led to overconfidence and the subsequent downfall of more than one of their adversaries. Koala witchers abjure signs and favour repeated rapid attacks to dispatch their foes, which they augment with a unique oil, the recipe for which is a closely guarded secret. If we are to believe these folk-tales, its name is: Koala Chlamydia.  edit: Minor improvements and corrections.

cxb6t1c	My pitch deck for my startup in Air Medical Rescue Services (critiques wanted!)	Thanks for your feedback, should I add my below responses as part of the video or should I just add it to the text of the profile?  - I can maybe get a letter of support from the government, especially if it would ensure getting the business from the government, hospitals or insurance companies.  Not guaranteed, but I'm already working for it.   - for another company to compete, they would have to be Bermudian, have access to doctors, nurses, flight training etc... Anything is possible but it's a high barrier of entry.   - the reason for the investment is to partly to get an aircraft (we have the one we want picked out), equipment etc.  I think it's a smarter idea to lease than buy, but that's open to conversation.   	"Harder, better, faster" doesn't mean more sales.  > The government officials, citizens and physicians at the hospital are frustrated with the the current situation and welcome our service  Can you make them sign on a line that's dotted that they will switch to your service the moment you're ready? Why can't an established company offer that 3 hours service the moment they hear of you? How can you assure them you'll do better the moment you will have too much clients to fly out of Bermuda?  Do you even have an helicopter or a plane (or whatever you use to get people out of there)?  If I'm going to invest in your business, I would need more proofs than that.  But at least, you have a really original business. You have something that I can believe in. You have something that will take efforts and could be rewarding.	None	None	0

dpxe8gf	Some people are drawing the line at poaching	I'm not a conservationist. I don't see any real value in keeping elephants alive. Other than the, "Oh that's an animal I learned about in my childhood," factor. Many species go extinct all the time, a lot of them because of humans.  I understand the argument about "ecosystems" and the unbalance it can create. Which is an argument that I do accept for preservation. However, I don't see any arguments that defend conservation of elephants coming from this angle.  That all said, I'm apathetic to poaching laws. It doesn't matter to me if poaching laws are enacted... or not. I just don't feel strongly about elephants.	I don't know what stance anyone could take to justify this. It's sick and disgusting.

e1gzngg	Do you use tire shine?	I tried Perl recently, it literally washed off after a single drive. It wasn't raining although the road was a little wet from rain earlier in the day.	Of course there are other products out there.  303, Perl, and others are dressings which are not high shine.	I think it's more of a practical thing, rather than a preference.   A brand new tire is dark black and matte.  Yes, that does look great.  However after getting some sun a tire turns grey'ish and kind of chalky.  It's just cheap and readily available to grab some tire shine and quickly make them dark black and shiny!   There may be  product out there for dark black and matte, but I'm assuming the shine is just cheaper and more readily available. 	I don't believe any tire product to really be that long lasting, but yeah, a single drive isn't good durability.  I use 303 and the initial "look" of it is definitely lessened significantly after the first wet drive.  That's sort of a universal "dressing" thing as far as I know.  Some kind of sealant or different product would last longer.	0

It's originally designed to redirect airflow away from the curvy-curve on the sides of the chassis near the tail, apparently air kept flowing sideways over the curvy-curves (bad) instead of backwards (good), spoiler fixes that.

Using someone else feelings just to boost up your reputation, is not a really good thing.   The seduction way of life is more than getting chicks and have an ego booster. It's something that should help you to imprrove as a person to yourself and the people around you.   BTW you are not using the term "whiteknigt" correctly. 	Christ what's with all the white knights in this thread? Fucking pathetic.  Don't dump her dude, just keep dating her and start dating other girls too. The more girls you are dating the easier it is to find newer, hotter girls. Everyone knows that.  You never dump a girl unless you never want to fuck her again. Just use her to level up with other chicks and then when you get too many chicks for your schedule to handle then you dump the least attractive one which is probably going to be her.  Simple 🤷‍♂️  Edit: And what kind of faggy shit is "being too much of a player?"	None	0
e5rdq5g	Has anyone dealt with patella-femoral syndrome?	The slant board eccentrics were like magic for me. Guess different things work for different peeps	For me the cure was 1. Switching exclusively to Pause Squats and 2. Doing a bit of low-intensity biking everyday: no big rides. no lycra. just riding around the neighborhood.   &#x200B;  I tried partial single legged squats on a slant board, foam rolling, stretching, heat, whatever. Nothing helped like Easy Biking and Pauses. I was like you where it was at its worst sitting - especially in the car.   &#x200B;  As far as I know, the research says easy aerobic exercise (biking, walking, etc) blows away the trendier forms of recovery (massage, sauna, ice baths, foam rolling, acupuncture, cupping, chiro, those balloon pants, CBD Oil, whatever). Even though a cold ice bath or an ART session can be painful, all those solutions are passive activities. Nothing is gonna get the blood moving like actual movement.   &#x200B;  &#x200B;	None	None	0

e5sq6hh	Focus RS as Second Car?	&gt; You'll very likely learn before you even roast the first clutch.  Implying that someone who had never driven manual before would roast a clutch trying to learn? Maybe if it's already a toasted clutch, but it's not that hard to learn. 	I don't think the RS is less practical than the other options you mentioned. They're all hot hatches, from a practicality standpoint.   Learning manual won't be too hard, as you understand the concepts. The only real difference is that dirt bikes and (nearly all) street bikes use wet clutches that can be slipped more and are less grabby. You'll get the hang of it though. Also, Ford is pretty good about paying for the first clutch. The second maybe. The third probably not. You'll very likely learn before you even roast the first clutch.  You know what you like. As long as you can afford it, there's no reason not to buy whatever you want. Test drive them and see!	None	Not something that would happen to most people. But absolutely possible, and I've seen it.

e6d1ee0	Am I the only one who is glad they cancelled regionals?	You mean literally the exact same thing you’re doing? When do they put other people down? I don’t see any posts about how annoying it is when people don’t go to regionals. You sound jealous.	Completely agree.  I'm 35 never had aspirations nor the skills or genetics to be a regionals athlete.  I love it for the health aspect.  Just get tired of hearing guys talking about "grinding" or putting other people down who aren't able to make as much time for working out as they do.  There are other ways to "grind" besides inside the gym.  	not going to lie I don't disagree with your point. Being a regionals athlete is not a job neither is exercising for the most part. I had one guy at the gym, who had regionals aspirations, ask if I hated being controlled by the corporate "man". I told him that health insurance for my family, a growing 401K and a consistent salary are not something I would ever trade even as much as I love exercising. For those that can make a living doing this I salute them, for many others I think it is an excuse not to have to grow up and get a real job. 	None	0

He really only said two things in the whole recording anyway, they were just for lengthy diatribes each.  I’d have to rewatch the Schneizel scene to see if it’s as believable or not.	Someone online pointed out that the Mao scene was much more believable than Schneizel's. I agree with that assessment.  Lelouch's prerecorded speech to Schneizel was so perfectly timed and so specifically in line with Schneizel's answers/assertions that it breaks my suspension of disbelief. By contrast, Lelouch's speech to Mao was more open-ended and generic, and the timing and wording was off in parts -- just as you would expect from a prerecorded one-sided speech.	it also foreshadowed lelouchs recording himself to have a future conversation predicting what to say and when	None	0

ecfm6e4	Am I too big?	Well the skates you have are a pretty old-school style of aggressive model (meant for tricks, primarily grinds), and I've never heard of the brand, so they're probably not the best quality unfortunately. Those wheels are tiny, which was the style back in the day, since it made cess slides and ledge grinds easier, and I'm sure they'd be fine for that purpose, but certainly will give you a bad experience trying to get comfortable rolling around. The best solution is to get a pair from a more mainstream manufacturer like Rollerblade, K2, Seba, Powerslide, etc. I'd be happy to help you pick something out if that's an option.   However, if new skates aren't an option due to cost, availability, or whatever, there are still some things you can try.    * Get larger wheels - ideally the largest ones that will fit in the frame and still roll freely. Quality new bearings never hurt either.    * If the frames (wheel chassis) are removable UFS frames, then you've really got options. https://www.grindhouse.eu/Produktinfos/Allgemeine-Infos-zu-Frames/General-Information-about-Frames-II.html Any skate that follows the UFS standard can take any UFS frame with just 2 bolts to hold it in place. I'd recommend an alluminum chassis frame by Seba, Rollerblade, Powerslide, or Ground Control if you're not planning to do any grinds (80mm or larger max wheel size). If your aim is to do grinds, try the larger-wheel aggressive frame options out there to reduce the drag issues, e.g. Oysi frames, GC BIG frames, or Kizer Level [1, 2, or 3] frames.    * Remove some or all of the part of the skate that's giving you trouble. Especially if you don't plan on doing grinds any time soon, if the soul plates are removable try taking them out. If you plan on grinding in the future, see if you can just unscrew them, but if you doubt you ever will, feel free to take a dremel to any excess plastic you don't see a need for. You might be able to thin the edges of the frame if there is a lot of protruding plastic, although you should be very careful not to compromise the functionality or structural integrity of the frame or boot.   * Check out some tutorials youtube about proper form. It's entirely possible that some of your issues come from correctible problems with how you skate.   I don't want you to feel bad about the skates you have, but I'd really hate for you to quit skating because of a less-than-ideal setup for your needs.   Let me know if you have any more questions!	The brand is RD, not sure the model it's worn off. http://imgur.com/a/wSoIESD	A lot of my best friends are fatasses, it's not (necessarily just) the weight. It sounds like you've just got some issues with your setup. Can you post deets on what you're riding, and preferably a picture?	Thanks man I'll try and figure something out.

Cause I liked to travel alone, explore cities in my own and meet people in hostels, but I dont want to hear them talk about how they just finished their studies while I am still on it and cant really get it done. If that werent the case and I were actually finished, I would probably like traveling again. 	Let's say all your financial troubles are gone. You go on vacation. But eventually it will end, and you'll have to go back to some work. Do you enjoy your vacation while you're on it?	Oh, I didn’t mean to say that I wouldn’t enjoy the vacation because it ends at some point. I meant to say that I don’t enjoy vacation because even then I’m reminded of my problems.   And for the record, I would probably eat the candy, since it’s gone either way I might as well enjoy it one last time. Doesn’t mean I feel bad about it being discontinued. 	0

I think it's pretty clear that Mando's patents die during the Clone Wars, considering we see a Super Battle Droid in the flashback.   Considering one of the Mandalorians states "Our world was shattered by the Empire", it's easy to assume purge is the "shattering" that he referred to. Also, the purge isn't referred to in Rebels, yet appears to have had devastating effects on Mandalorian culture implying the purge happens after the events of the TV show. The Empire employing a strategy of complete destruction to conclude the Mandalorian civil war would be likely considering how they handled other rebellions and uncooperative planets (see Alderaan and Mon Cala).

Not to say PS is a bad game (I brought and am going to keep playing because it is fun) but it's definitely got that arma lite feel to it (where it tries to make everything slower and more pain that it would be in irl to try and slow things down) and everything positive I have to say about it can be hit with a BUT right afterwards.  For example the sound design is amazing BUT this means wrong sounds or when the sound bugs out it's super fucking noticable and annoying. For example did you kill someone moving in a bush? That bush is going to continue russling and making noise like someone else is there until his body despawns making it sound like there's someone still alive there....  Are you crouch walking alone in a building? We are going to play the jogging sound at a lower volume making it sound like you are taking 10steps per meter or like there's someone in there with you - which is it this time?!  Or the guns are great, the animations are solid and mostly very realistic BUT you fucking rack your slide on the 1911 every time you pull it out wtf you dont carry with one in the chamber? If I'm pulling my side arm it's as a back up in a bad situation idk why some have such long draw out animations of cocking the hammer or waiting to hit the safety until it's in front of your face smh.   Also idk why you slap the gun with your magazine before inserting it (like with the Thompson or STG) it looks super dumb.  The movement is decent and I can appreciate that it's supposed to be realistic (which is to say it tries to fuck with anyone trying to get fancy with it) BUT if it was going to realism why can't I vault over small walls? Like if I'm getting shot at I don't want to climb ontop of this 3ft wall I wanna duck behind it not lazily climb it to be a free kill wtf even HLL got this right before their animation overhaul.	You havent played but are talking about it like this? Oof	I feel like HLL is more of a hardcore BF where as PS looks more like Arma Lite.  I want to enjoy a shooter with team work and strategy on a large scale.  I like the relatively fast paced gameplay, less down time, more engagements, smaller maps and leathal weapons make for epic flanks, as a result i feel like as a single player i can have a decent impact on a game - i just enjoy the pacing and the way combat plays out (im nervous that the infantry vehicles will fuck this up).  I'll admit that PS's wider range of factions does look very attractive but at the end of the day whats the point in having all these unique and interesting guns and what not when for most of the game you arent going to be using them because your going to be on the move and then when you do its spamming suppressing fire at a hedge.  Edit: to be clear i might be 100% wrong about PS i havent played it but thats just the vibe i got from the gameplay ive seen.	None	0

fp4ebwj	video games working on specific channels	I still remember the TVs with the big heavy channel knob... you'd turn it and it would go "chunk chunk chunk chunk".  The TV numbers with the backlit film were pretty cool, you could see at a distance with nice bold orange letters which channel you were on.  Then sometimes you'd get the vertical sync start creeping, and you'd have to fight with the vertical sync knob.  Other times as a kid you get bored and start turning the tint  to turn everyone into Martians, everyone has a good laugh for about five minutes.	(shouting from the roof) "IS IT COMING IN BETTER NOW?"  Also, turning the TV to the UHF channel and twiddling the tuning knob like a safecracker, hoping for a blurry orange glimpse of a boob from the Playboy Channel.	None	And don't turn the channel too fast! You'll break the knob! Remember how you did that to the last TV and we had to use needle nose pliers to change the channel?	0

fptyj0r	No motivation to study atm	Eh. I think the quality of most of these TEFL courses is questionable, not finding them engaging and rather boring seems like it would be a very normal reaction. I suspect the CELTA is much better but its also expensive so most people will only take it once they know that they definitely like teaching.  A course being boring doesn't mean the course taker is lazy, it often just means it's a poorly designed course, you're an educator so you must be aware of that.	If you can't muster up the motivation to complete a TEFL, this might not be the industry for you.  EDIT: Downvote all you want, I know I am right, and so do you. To make this a rewarding career takes a lot of hard work. If an assignment on a 120 hour TEFL cert is too difficult, you were going to become just another backpacker that gives other teachers a bad name.	None	True. But, lesson planning for a level you are familiar with or a language point you are familiar with is also very boring. Admin work is boring. Writing term comments for multiple classes is boring. Grading stacks of exams is also really boring. Teaching itself can be a joy, but let's be real, a large part of the job is boring. The work still needs to get done.	0

frx5wqr	May 26 Daily Thread	&gt; inspiring and a little annoying.  Lol that's great dude.   That was very similar to my thought process.   There were guys on the football and hockey teams back in college that were absolutely jacked, and fast.	Week two of nSuns + Hal Higdon HM Intermediate 2 began today. Started nSuns about a month ago after PHUL while running ~10 mi per week here and there. Decided to get my ass in gear with a real running plan again. I am tired of being in the 9:00/mi pace range.   Week 1 went well; hit 5-7 reps on all of my 1+ sets, and finished all of my miles just fine.   I used to think running and lifting were incongruous, and stupid to do on the same day. Then I realized - uh, hey idiot, you did this in sports for years and you were fine. Plus, seeing /u/nSuns be a much better version of me was inspiring and a little annoying.	None	Absolutely. It's totally doable, just have to really take recovery seriously.   Now all I need to do is come up with a name for the combo program, like "Snigdons" or "Halsuns". Or "Hell".	0
fs28kr5	Its not big or fancy, but its DIY by me! Path re-grade and replace.	Would that include renting one of those big concrete drills?

I'm hoping to replace our front walk one day with pavers, and I'm sort of counting on that stuff.	I called the city to find out if I needed a permit just to do the work, and they had said not for repairs like that and as long as I want using any power tools. I thought it was a little strange but maybe due to the gas line?	You have to get a permit to use a power tool??? I've never heard of that. Like, who is policing this?

fsolyyi	TLSS looks to be finished	Jesus these discussions sound exactly like the ones I read about Spongetech back in the day.  All the grasping at straws, all the "if they're so shady, then why would they buy advertising during a prime-time Yankee game?"  etc.	If MGN hadnt bought stock in them yesterday, I would have sold.  Instead Ive doubled. If TLSS really was shady as fuck, why would a well-known company like MGN logistics buy shares in them? Personally, I think theres been a shit ton of whales shorting TLSS constantly the part couple of days, so they can get cheapies for when TLSS starts to rise again before Q1 earnings are released in late June. And with a global pandemic going on and people instead buying from Amazon, those should be good.  The moral of the story here is that I hate and somewhat love whales	None	They are penny stocks for a reason. I’m not throwing my life savings into penny stocks, except for maybe GNUS because of their connections to Amazon, Netflix, Alibaba, but they scared me off when they diluted the shit out of them even though they said they were great financially. That being said, their CEO helped found Coach USA, so he’s not like the MVIS guy that we knew nothing about his background. It’s still not much better off than gambling, but I’m not going to buy any VOO or SPY shares until the market breaks again.	0
fszmz8u	How to git gud?	Game sense and positioning will take a while to improve at, but correct sensitivity can bump your accuracy 10+ percentage points pretty much instantly. You will still struggle to win straight up fights in some cases, but it will increase your consistency and ability to get picks on targets.  I find it helpful to download recurision stat tracker or use another available stat tracker to track your session stats. The other benefit is that you get fun voice callouts when you kill people. Above all else, prioritize an accuracy of at least 30%. It may be difficult to achieve at first, but if you are not improving towards it, your most likely culprits are your framerate or your sensitivity.  For light assault, the primary carbine is good. Laser or foregrip is your choice, depending on playstyle and feel free to play around with both. Headshots are important with the 167 damage model that it has, and doubly so after changing your sensitivity, but prioritize accuracy first.  I would recommend sticking with the primary carbine until you get over 1k kills on it, so that you have a consistent platform.     Some random tips:     * Don't sprint through doorways. * Always be moving side to side.  * Carry medkits unless you have a specific reason not to. A properly timed medkit can save your life. * Make every effort to limit the amount of enemies that can see you at one time. Fight two one one as a light assault means you will trade at best.  * Always look for a flank.  * Motion spotters and radar darts are your #1 enemy, but you will have a hard time dealing with them. Back off and find another spot, or bait enemies.	I have done most of the basic purchases, like maxing out class abilities, and nanoweave, though I should upgrade that. I haven't played much with sensitivity though. I need to try that. I just play with the default that I use everywhere, but I can easily adjust it.   And I do play other classes here and there. I just got the other AI MAX arm, and have used that a little. I have used medic and engineer a little, but I have almost always played light assault, and that has probably caused me to get lazy. I just love the ability to fly.	I would suggest trying different guns firstly. Mods for guns can make them easier to handle. I dont know nc weaponry so cant recommend their easy weapons.   If you want to practice headshots, do some infiltrator work. Don't limit yourself to just two classes either. HA with a sheild should be able to outlast most other troopers if you have any aim at all.  learn your ranges on guns, what guns are good at what ranges. get a nice 3m mouse pad, and clean your  mouse bottom if you are having tracking issues. Play with mouse sensitivity in ps2.  i would purchase nanoweave armor first off because that will help you not die. and your class specific abilities, like jet pack of choice, maxed out, etc...  You can always get a million kills camping some angle in a biolab. can practice aim like that, crouched and zoomed in on a doorway for example.	None	0

It wasn't exactly easy; in fact, I sometimes found it emotionally difficult. But I made decent money for at-home work, and because I can read very fast and score accurately, I got lots of bonuses. It was seasonal and you could decline offers to score, which also helped.  At-home writing critiques didn't have bonuses, and the team leader reviews could be very nitpicky, which is why I ultimately quit. I didn't like feeling that micromanaged for a few extra dollars. But it was also less emotionally draining, and I felt like I could be a bit creative with my critiques. After about 6 months of doing it, I had saved some general critiques that I could copy, paste, and modify a bit to suit that particular writer, so it became slightly easier work I could do for an hour while getting ready for my full-time job in the morning.

g63hhp8	What’s the smallest sailboat you would feel comfortable using to cross an ocean?	How would you compare the motion between the huge cat and the 42' mono?   Was the cat just more comfortable in every sense, including motion? Or was it more just that a 54' cat has lots of cabins and a nice saloon?	I prefer 30' as an absolute minimum, although people circumnavigate on a few very specific models of smaller boat (Flicka or Contessa 26).  I've crossed the Atlantic in a 54' Catamaran  (very comfy) and a 42' monohull (less comfy but very seaworthy).  My personal boat is a West Sail 42, and she is an absolute tank offshore - we weathered 5 days of 55+ knots against the Gulf Stream (massive waves) and she didn't flinch.  Far more important than size is condition of rig and hull,  and safety gear. Some boats are unsafe in any conditions regardless of size. For example, most wooden boats or cheap production boats like Hunters and Lagoons are made for calm waters, not good offshore.  People do sail them offshore, but there are much better options if that's your plan.	None	Part of it was that the monohull crossing was "uphill", from BVIs to Europe, we had gales and calms. The cat I took from UK to Caribbean, so mostly downwind in nice tradewinds.  Overall for comfort the cat was waaay better, but cats are expensive to buy and own, and if they capsized they tend to stay that way. For us normal humans a nice cozy monohull is a better solution for offshore, maybe less roomy and comfortable but safe and affordable.   For what it's worth, if you look at catamarans, note how narrow the bow is and how high the bridge deck (middle bit) clears the water. it's a good way to see how seaworthy it is. Higher clearance means a better ride in rougher conditions, and a narrow bow can save your life if the bow gets buried in a wave. Imagine lifting a shovel (wide bow) out of the water vs lifting a knife blade (narrow bow). Compare a Lagoon to a Gunboat on these specs alone and you can see the difference. Survival++	0
g63i1lq	How bad of an idea is it to buy this J/24?	Basically you're going to cut off the top layer of fiber glass, and remove it.   This should expose whatever they've used as the middle of the "sandwich" between the two glass layers.   It's probably soggy plywood, or end grain balsa, etc. You then scrape all this soggy shit out and replace it with new material, epoxy/seal the material, then glass over it again.   It's labor intensive but shouldn't be rocket surgery.   Try looking up some youtube videos on "sailboat deck core replacement".	Thank you. Can you elaborate on what it's like to re-core parts of deck?	The cracks look like they may be related to whatever hardware was installed there previously, possibly turning or downhaul blocks. Those can induce a lot of stress, especially if that area is not designed for it. Also, it looks the holes where the hardware was mounted go directly into the deck, without much to keep water out. Inspect this area very closely. You might have to replace parts of the deck if it is waterlogged. For the price you are looking at, this is not a huge deal overall.	None	0
g6fkraw	Slacker -- slow...down [Latin Electronic Chill] (2020)	As someone who uses a 32 key keyboard regularly, kinda but not really.   The instrument is focused around recording, whether that’s loops, chord progressions, melodies, etc. Most likely you’re going to be playing one-hand chords and one-key melodies the vast majority of the time.   You can move the octave up and down as needed on all 32 key keyboards I’ve seen, so you’re not limited sound-wise, and if you need a larger keyboard - maybe for bass notes and chords at the same time - you just go back over and record the bass notes after.  If you were going to record a more classical type of piece you’d definitely need a full keyboard, but in that case you wouldn’t be using an OP-1 anyway.	These kinds of controllers always make me wonder how you can write on something so small? I mean, in concept it's a beautiful interface, but don't the micro-keys, the non-pianistic feel, and the two octave range make it a little limiting?	None	My background is very jazz oriented. I was just trying to imagine having to build five note chords on the micro keys, but then again. If it's being layered, you could always do it that way.	0

g6l8jgt	I'm ready for the hate comments and Downvotes	 My verdict on the first two games is that they do have some interesting mechanics but are still a bit too easy. If you have some time to kill then there are certainly much worse ways to do it. Though note that eighty percent of the game is fetch-quests.  The battle system is fairly autonomous. You have three mons active at any given time and they will act out their turn independently from you. Either doing a regular attack, Elemental attack or buffing or debuffing another mon (Referred to as “inspiriting”). The player can switch out which mons are active by rotating a wheel on the touchscreen. You also decide when your mons use their special attack.

g7xcluw	Major cuts to public transportation	u/thebruns I think this is a generalization. The commuter rail  has stops in a lot of areas where disenfranchised populations live. Although, I think the service cuts and barrier to entry (cost, schedule, location of stops) are horrible for all.	Commuter rail has very high subsidies per rider. If these folks want to flee to the suburbs, they need to cough up $20 a ride to cover their costs.	The service cuts to the commuter rail seem poorly thought out with all the flight to the burbs that is happening.	Aside from the Fairmount line, which I believe came from a court agreement 20+ years ago, the CR network caters to the very affluent.	0

The military is like, the only social mobility tool open to everyone, and that's not a good thing.  Opening education to everyone will force us to focus on improving QOL and retaining competence.   I see no issue with recruits being older, maybe a little wiser, and with the at least partial education of your general electives and english/math.  If we're then recruiting people who WANT to be there, not just in and out for college, we should then be able to perform better in a more professional environment. Focus on cutting the fat of those who still join for this simple pay check. Normalize and even mandate education in english/writing/logic/argument and math and humanities while in.

Depends what you mean by so much. The case is often overstated by the kind of people that tend to talk about hypergamy the most but it is certainly a significant factor in female mate selection. Women almost never marry down although it is becoming more common since the earnings gap between women and men has drastically decreased.	None	0

ga7d98n	[IWantOut] 23M Brazil / Linguistics field -> Denmark/Norway/Sweden	Small correction: With an EU passport, you have to pay the same tuition as Dutch people in the Netherlands, which is around €2150. If you don't have one, it starts at a couple of tens of thousands of euro's a year just for tuition.	Getting Italian citizenship will absolutely change things. Especially since humanities isn't a field easy to find job sponsorship, having EU citizenship means you don't need sponsorship. You can stay in the country without a time limit (many countries offer a sort of job-seeking permit for third state citizen graduates, giving them usually a year to find a job that will get them a work permit to stay in the country). In short: you have a better shot at employment in your field, and easier immigration with EU citizenship.  Some countries also have no-tuition for EU citizens, I can't remember all of them but Finland does, and I believe the Netherlands, and I'd imagine Sweden and Denmark. Look it up. Norway is tuition-free anyway.  What are you aiming for as your career path? I'd figure that out to help narrow down your specific targets, something I'm sure your professors can help with.

gbznf72	Is CS Lewis’ argument against naturalism sound?	&gt;If our reasoning is not wholly reliable, then why would It be reliable at all?  Because it's not an all or nothing situation.  &gt;I mean obviously it’s not wholly reliable  Then it seems you would agree that Lewis' argument is not compelling.  &gt;if your brain isn’t fundamentally different from the weather, then why would you consider it remotely reliable if it’s non-rational (like the weather).  This is the same as asking "If a table isn't fundamentally different from the weather, why can't a cloud hold up my computer." We are different. Our components and the laws that govern them may be the same, but their particular arrangements are vastly different. It is the arrangement of matter that bestows the properties of said matter. Particular arrangements of matter are capable of logic, humans and computers being some examples of such.	If our reasoning is not wholly reliable, then why would It be reliable at all? I mean obviously its not wholly reliable, but what Im saying is that if your brain isnt fundamentally different from the weather, then why would you consider it remotely reliable if its non-rational (like the weather).	I don't think that determinism necessarily leads to our reasoning being unreliable, but it would most likely lead to our reasoning being not perfectly reliable. This seems to be the case as demonstrated by our proclivity to falling pray to a host of various cognitive biases. So Lewis seems to be arguing against his own point here. Which ironically is a further demonstration of our reasoning not being perfectly reliable.	I am trying to understand the argument myself, so clearly I can really articulate something I’m having trouble understanding. Thoughts on this quotation?  >All possible knowledge, then, depends on the validity of reasoning. If the feeling of certainty which we express by words like ‘must be’ and ‘therefore’ and ‘since’ is a real perception of how things outside our own minds really ‘must’ be, well and good. But if this certainty is merely a feeling in our own minds and not a genuine insight into realities beyond them—if it merely represents the way our minds happen to work—then we can have no knowledge. Unless human reasoning is valid no science can be true. [. . .] But we can believe in the validity of thought only under certain conditions. Consider the following sentences, (1) ‘He thinks that dog dangerous because he has often seen it muzzled and he has noticed that messengers always try to avoid going to that house.’ (2) ‘He thinks that dog dangerous because it is black and ever since he was bitten by a black dog in childhood he has always been afraid of black dogs.’ [. . .] The real difference is that in the first instance the man’s belief is caused by something rational (by argument from observed facts) while in the other it is caused by something irrational (association of ideas). We may in fact state it as a rule that no thought is valid if it can be fully explained as the result of irrational causes. [. . .] Now it would clearly be preposterous to apply this rule to each particular thought as we come to it and yet not to apply it to all thoughts taken collectively, that is, to human reason as a whole. Each particular thought is valueless if it is the result of irrational causes. Obviously, then, the whole process of human thought, what we call Reason, is equally valueless if it is the result of irrational causes. [. . .] The mind, like every other particular thing or event, is supposed to be simply the product of the Total System. It is supposed to be that and nothing more, to have no power whatever of ‘going on of its own accord’. And the Total System is not supposed to be rational. [. . .] The finest piece of scientific reasoning is caused in just the same irrational way as the thoughts a man has because a bit of bone is pressing on his brain. If we continue to apply our Rule, both are equally valueless.  ~ C. S. Lewis, Miracles p. 246-284	0
gc7kjtn	The Case for the Argument From Reason	&gt;we can’t reasonably believe in a system which entails that our reason is faulty.  Sure we can, we just must temper our degree of certainty.   &gt;it undercuts its own ability to be believed reasonably.  It introduces doubt, but it does not give us reason to reject our reason outright. It would seem this would be true of any account of reasoning.	Disclaimer: the argument from reason sucks  However, its not arguing that the universe couldnt be such that our reasoning is faulty. Its pointing out that we cant reasonably believe in a system which entails that our reason is faulty, because it undercuts its own ability to be believed reasonably. This is known as cognitive instability. There are problems with this argument, but this isnt one of them.	>If an account of the universe leaves it impossible for our thinking to be reliable, then we must assume that account of the universe is false.  This is a non-sequitur. It's fine if you are uncomfortable with the fact that our reasoning is quite often faulty, but the universe is under no obligation to make us comfortable. Now if the universe were the result of some loving creator, we may have reason to think it were so obliged. After all, I want my loved ones to be comfortable. This should serve as weak evidence against such a creator to anyone whose reasoning is acting toward the more reliable end of the spectrum.	To be clear, I’m speaking of a system that entails our reason can’t be trusted at all, not just that it can’t be 100% trusted. The former is what this argument aspires to establish on naturalism, and if it succeeded, that would indeed lead to cognitive instability. The latter is inherent to any system that purports to describe our reality - our reason is obviously not perfect.	0

gct1p9g	BSOD twice on a refurbished laptop in the first month - should I return it?	Hey, thanks for your reply. I went ahead and ran mdsched.exe and it came back normal. I don't have a spare USB to run Memtest86, though. I also ran a full diagnostics test on https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/ (which includes a 60 minute test for memory) and everything came back normal.   Lenovo's website says there was a warranty on this computer from 2013-2016, which I assume was the original owner. It could be older than 7 years, though, that's just my theory.  The two random BSODs within the first month is still worrisome and baffling.	The errors you report tell me most likely there's a problem with the RAM, but it could be something else. You can try running mdsched.exe or Memtest86.  Also, I don't know where you got that 7+ year figure from, but if it wasn't on a datasheet from Lenovo I wouldn't trust it.	None	I suspect the memory is defective anyway, these memory tests are far from perfect, though they work reasonably well with DDR3 RAM.  I would try the system with different RAM.	0

It was fantastic, thank you!  To summarize, she said she gained 200 Elo in only a few months with only 15 minutes (!!) per day in spaced repetition, and she is nearly 1800 USCF now. Although she also has a regular coach and she also sometimes also gets help from an IM, so this must have helped too.  She puts anything she wants to remember on her digital notecards, meaning pretty much everything, including advice from her coaches, and said that she has often seen the patterns she has memorized directly come up in her over the board games. So this was very encouraging to hear that it helped her so much.

gdu78k2	Manually validating STV	Yeah I haven't seen those proposals but I can imagine something like that might work in theory. In practice, they'd never implement all the pieces to make it work, and even if they did, it could easily get watered down by future governments until it's no longer providing sufficient safeguards.  And if it's not available online then it's not really providing any public benefit, it might be cheaper but that's not an important consideration.  If there *is* ongoing pressure for online voting then the path of least resistance is to dispense with the secret ballot. I think that would be a mistake but it would be less of a mistake than just trusting the government to do the right thing with your HTTP request.	I've seen end-to-end voter verifiable electronic voting systems, but they're pretty complex to avoid issues with fraud and vote buying. They generally involve:  1. The voter being able to "challenge" the voting machine to check if it's cheating 2. Posting encrypted ballots to a public board, where anyone can check that their encrypted ballot is present 3. A "mixing" procedure that allows ballots to be decrypted without revealing who cast them, while being sure they do all represent real ballots  Then anyone can run the algorithm on the resulting ballots. These methods probably still have weaknesses though. And they do still require secret ballots, so it's electronic, but not online.	None	I don't think it's a good idea to eliminate the secret ballot, it's mostly to prevent vote buying and voter coercion, which with online voting I could see being pretty large-scale.  I have also seen schemes that allow online voting while preventing vote buying and voter coercion with some voter verifiable elements, but they aren't end-to-end verifiable. IIRC Estonia actually uses one.  They generally involve allowing voters to "update" or "re-cast" their vote, so even if a buyer verified that a seller voted as instructed once, they'd have no way of verifying they kept it that way.  The verifiable elements come from being given a "vote-reference" code which can be used from any machine to check its associated ballot, but the reference doesn't get updated if the voter changes their vote, so it's just to make sure that the vote was recorded correctly. It can't verify how a person actually ends up voting  Edit: Hmm, I have seen another, [non-electronic scheme](https://rangevoting.org/RivSmiAnswers.html) who's ideas might be able to enhance this. It was called "TWIN" I think, it involved being given a copy of a random ballot which had already been cast after casting your own ballot. After the election, all the ballots would be posted, and you could check to make sure the copy you were given was preset. If enough people did this, even small amounts of fraud could be detected. IIRC it didn't actually take that many checking to do this, and you could give your copy to a dedicated org you trust to do it for you.  Maybe this could be used to enhance Estonia's system? When you cast a ballot, you don't just get your own vote reference, you get someone else's too. Then after the election, ALL ballots, including overridden ones, would be posted, and you could check to make sure the one for your random reference was accounted for. Ones which are overridden would be marked as such, and the vote reference you're given is never the same reference as what the original caster got, so each ballot has at least two reference which lead back to it, one given to the caster, one given to verifiers. Otherwise a buyer could require the voter's reference and use it to track down the ballot here to check if it's marked overridden.  I'm sure I'm missing something though.	0

That's the problem with \*repeatedly\* fucking up in order to mire your reputation. This isn't just that they released a buggy game that wasn't ready. It was that they released a buggy game that got delayed three times and had an eight year development cycle. Which they hyped up to the max, and promised a myriad of things that are definitely not present.

I bought the game, I enjoyed it, and I didn't mind the crashes and bugs here and there, but I was most disappointed when I learned perks and cyberware aren't working properly, so I decided to put the game aside for now until CDPR fix it.

ggd12i3	lol	I mean honestly yeah that's about it. He's also angry that it isn't formulaic enough or dares focusing on enhancing strong emotional beats over minute details.  The part that pisses me off though is that he liked it the first time, then over subsequent viewings started to dislike it. When something's reliant on a major twist, of course it isn't going to be as effective when you know the twist lol.	I didn't watch the entire video, anybody have a tl;dw on what his criticisms are?  All I could gather was that he was mad about the twist and considered it a plothole.	None	Sadly this is a common occurrence with this movie. Like when A silent voice overtook Your name's MAL score, a bunch of people were like 'Yeah, I rated Your name higher in the past but after a few years/ subsequent viewings, I don't think it's all that good'. They're just forgetting how good it was the first time, it really annoys me.  And the movie's actually great for multiple watches. It looks amazing, has great music and things flow very satisfyingly. It broke box office records precisely cause people watched it many times.	0

ggjziqb	WHO is the best minecraft player in the world part 1	I stand corrected.	He had to call iskall to make an automated iron door. Awesamdude made a fricking redstone prison those two cannot be compared	On the Dream SMP I'd say it would have to be Fundy. I'd give him As in each of those categories, with bonus points for his coding skills.  PVP: He held his own against Sapnap who can give Dream a run for his money on a good day.  Building: He has made some of the nicest builds on the SMP, especially when it comes to detailing.  Redstone: He makes Tubbo look like a dunce. Tubbo and Awesamdude seem to be at a similar level when they work together and Awesamdude is responsible for some of the cleverest redstone on the server.  He also writes plugins, like the one that shows his camera through particle effects, which a whole level of Minecraft expertise that you haven't even considered in your list.

So  Dream is still not clear ?	https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/kiqosv/-/ggse2er  Also Dream forgot to mention that the final odds biased in his favor were still 1 in 100 million.	great....	0
gguedw0	The math specifics aren’t important. Here’s why.	The 1 in 100000000 figure is the chance that ANYONE in the minecraft speedrunning community would be as lucky as Dream.   If there was 100000000 parallell universes with as many minecraft speedrunners as in this universe, there would only be an average of one person as lucky as Dream.	There are 200 milliom concurrent players on minecraft, that means that a 1 in 10 million event can happen 20 times a day or 140 times in a week. Its not as impossible but is still kind of unlikely. Giving dream the benefit of the doubt i don't think that 1 in 100 million would mean he cheated	>Now, according to the statistician hired by Dream, these odds have been reduced to 1 in 10 million, which is not a big enough number to conclude that Dream did in fact cheat.  You don't consider 1 in 10 million to be strong evidence of cheating? You do realize that scientists generally consider 1 in 20 to be strong evidence, right? I think people here don't seem to appreciate how unlikely 1 in 10 million is. The far likelier explanation is that Dream cheated.	None	0
ggv2129	Super phun boulder in CO!	Agreed. There's a problem almost exactly like this in Jtree on the Dino Egg boulder that is apparently a bat hang start, but there's some (admittedly poor) feet you could also use for a sit start, which makes the bat hang feel so contrived.	These types of low bat hang starts are a special kind of contrivance that I don't know I'll ever wrap my head around. I know, most of rock climbing is arbitrary and contrived, but I've come to terms with most of it. But there's just something about using the ground to place you feet above your head all so your hands are on the 'correct' startholds, only to hand-foot match and go right side up two moves later.

ghyexr4	Any Boston-based therapists that specialize in non-monogamous relationships?	I guess, I wouldn’t consider myself polyamorous.  I don’t date other people.  My partner and I are just in an open relationship where we are able to have casual hookups on the side.  And I guess I just want to see a therapist to help me through a whole bunch of a lot of different stuff I’m dealing with and I just want one who isn’t going to be super judgmental about someone being in an open relationship.	This list has been going around: https://www.friendlytherapy.info/therapist-list-1. I don't believe it's exclusively for polyamory but you might be able to filter if you look at it on a computer.	None	Generally, they aren't supposed to be super judgemental. I have not specifically looked for an accepting therapist but I didn't have any issues. I'm married to a man, and I went through approximately 4 therapists in the past two years (I had a lot of trouble finding someone who worked weekends, and didn't want to take work off because it's just mild anxiety) and none of them so much as raised an eyebrow when I mentioned my girlfriend.  Honestly, I probably could have used a therapist who actually wanted to talk about it, because my ex-girlfriend and I did have some issues that were causing me a lot of stress and guilt.	0
ghyi12q	Ford Escape S 2017 Questions	That's a really good suggestion, especially as covered in dust and metal shavings as I get sometimes at work. Need to check the local regulations for window tint.	Id suggest window tinting. Preserves the interior, keeps it cooler in the summer and prevents UV rays for you and the kiddo. May also look at leather seat covers that could make the seats less stain prone and a bit firmer.	None	You could at least do the back windows to the same pct as factory. Even a lighter tint provides the same UV protection and a noticeable difference in temps and intensity in the summer. Likewise a trick is if you’re doing 20% on the back a 35-50% isn’t as noticeable on the front. I’d also go for a leather steering wheel cover for better grip and temp control. If you wanted to get super fancy you could try to replicate the ambient lighting with LEDs but that’s some electrical splicing involved	0
ghyvrfa	Ford Escape S 2017 Questions	Can you elaborate a bit on what I should be doing in the event of a misfire at cold start? Do I need to shut it back off and immediately take it to the shop? And what tends to cause it?     As far as coolant and other leaks, the plan is to take it to the dealership at every milestone and have it gone over thoroughly, since the "ultra" package warranty was included with the deal, though I wouldn't mind replacing the transmission fluid in the next few weeks as a precaution.	All I'm suggesting is watch very closely for a misfire at cold start on he engine.  And regular maintenance to fix all the leaks.  Coolant tends to leak on escapes and mine is in for a 3rd engine in 54000kms	None	The misfire is a sign that coolant is leaking into the engine.  Be prepared to be ignored because it tend to happen on an cold engine start at first.  But you will see oil leaks, transmission leaks etc.  This is a symptom of the faulty engines.  Itll eventually get to the point you feel a misfire while driving and this will be the immediate precursor to total engine failure.  I've done this 3 times on 2 different years now and each time I brought this up during maintenance it was disregarded as being all in my head.	0

None	This is not accurate. Without a reservation, the scanner gets notification, even with a pass. As for lift lines, they haven’t been too bad except at the base lifts like Colorado or Independence but reservation limits have been further reduced under level red. Starting Monday under level orange, limits return to the previous limits laid out under the initial COVID plan. Hopefully Peak 6 and the T-bar open soon to handle incremental numbers.	0

She asked me this in front of the Director on my team and I was a bit surprised. Seemed kind of weird to be asking the client how to audit something. I didn't know exactly what the senior associate was doing to audit that specific piece, but I told her I thought that he was sampling based off of the largest JEs in the pull that we provide to them and sure enough a couple hours later we received a request to provide the support behind some of the largest JEs in the original support we provided to them.

gi203l2	3-day Old CP Soap Smells like Ammonia	I see this thrown about a lot, I have not seen any data backing it up though.	True castile soap (100% olive), which you have here, takes about a year to "fully cure". in that time the soap can go through many changes including; color, texture, and smell. odor in unscented soaps comes from the soap molocules (actual salted fatty acids) and the free floating, unsalted, fatty acids (represented by the super fat). most fatty acids have very potent and noticeable scents.   in this case you most likely are smelling something like the unsaponified Oleic Acid and not-fully cured castile. it is very likely that this smell will go away and even become pleasent with time :)  hope this was helpful! happy soaping	None	well, if you would like to proof it yourself.   Dissolve a small amount of solid soap in about a cup of water, or a couple tbs of liquid soap and add a solution of citric acid (1 part CA 2 parts water). the mix should instantly become cloudy and the now unsalted fatty acids will float to the  surface and you will be able to smell them for what they are! lol   there are no violent reactions or heat produced (i actually think the process leans more toward endothermic, but don't quote mexD)  coconut oil contains a lot of lauric acid which smells completely different than oleic acid.     its really fun to do the experiment with soaps of 100% coconut and olive oils so you can really see the difference:)	0

Brace  yourself: UU is not a belief.  It's actually very much distinct from Islam, which is both a faith and a set of prescriptions for right living. UUs have no issue with the first but would respectfully suggest the second is perhaps too narrow a focus.   Some of us believe in God. Some don't.  My reverend calls herself an 'apatheist' -- she doesn't care if there's a God or not.

gideyb1	What is Unitarian Universalism?	Our congregation is a lot like a traditional church: there are hymns, call and response, an offertory, a sermon -- the big difference is that the material varies from week to week: liberal Christian one week, Pagan the next, Indigenous the next...everything under the rainbow. (Oh, speaking of rainbows, our church and the larger community as a whole are extremely welcoming of all sexual minorities.   The one thing we do announce each week, which really resonates with me, at least:  Love is the doctrine of this church,  The quest for truth is its sacrament  and service is its prayer.   To dwell together in peace,  To seek knowledge in freedom,  To serve humanity in harmony with the earth,  Thus do we covenant together.	I wasn't braced.

gig6ktp	What self-hosted tool/app do you wish you had?	Not the person you replied to, but I've also been thinking of a self-hosted podcast manager. In my case I use Antenna Pod, and it has a really awesome setup around creating a queue, automatically fetching podcasts, etc etc.  But it's device specific: I can't really listen anywhere else but my phone, and if that device disappears, so does all my listening progress, "mark listened", subscriptions, and the queue itself. It has a [gpodder.net](https://gpodder.net) link functionality, but [gpodder.net](https://gpodder.net) is....not very reliable, at best. And it's not self hosted.  Having a self-hostable solution that could sync your subscriptions, listening progress, queue, and all that from a player like Antenna Pod (and maybe with its own web player) would be mint.	What do you mean exactly by manager? A client app that shows you new episodes of podcasts and lets you play them? Or an app that lets you organise your own podcast episodes for distribution etc.?	Podcast manager	From my understanding gpodder is down and has been for a month or more. I found this out when I needed to sync a fresh phone install to my older version. Still a few shows missing that I can't recall exactly, I had a written backup with the RSS links from a few months ago so it was not the most recent.   After the discovery of gpodder down.

Or is this simply a childish attempt to shitpost back at MRAs because they did it first?	Its the same as any MRA strawman comic.	And what do you believe this feminist straw man in comic form has anything to do with egalitarianism?	It’s simple, instead of making fun of feminists for strawman arguments, it’s illustrating what women *actually* have an issue with. Women’s issues belong here, right?   “Male sexuality” is not demonized, cat-calling is not “flirting”, and women do not owe sexist men politeness when they’re sexually harassed. Pretending that women think eye contact is rape is antifeminist MRA strawman bullshit.	0

Not only a new language, but a new alphabet to boot.	Honestly shouldnt she already have begun learning to speak his language? Shes waiting until she lives over there to start?

So I check out cousin's friend's page where he has pics of himself with the horned fur dude with a caption that explains how he's a good Christian man and to not let anyone smear him as Antifa,  among other selfies at the event.

I used to take a supplement called Hi-Lyte that helped me when I knew I needed electrolytes, and it stopped random cravings that were related to my body wanting those electrolytes.	If it's especially bananas, you might also be low on either potassium or B-6. The first is actually most likely, since you are so active.   I'd say just eat a banana or two, and maybe, if you have the resources to do so, have your blood checked to see if you're deficient in anything and your body is trying to tell you.

Introductory programming course? Exams were pages upon pages of handwritten code. And programs were graded not on whether or not rhey worked, but on whether or not they were written in the way the instructor wanted. You could have a perfectly functional program and still only get 70-80% of the points simply because you used the "wrong" type of loop.  And in the CAD course, they don't teach Solidworks or any other CAD program commonly used in industry like most other schools I know. Instead, they teach Fusion360, which is one of the most restrictive programs out there (and on a personal note, one of my least favorites)  It's frustrating, to say the least.	Arbitrarily contrived time constraints, pointless exercises, and frivolous rules often reveal the insecurity to the waning relevancy of a traditionalist.  Has he not heard of CAD?

gj5d7e7	Semi-Weekly Discussion Thread - January 11, 2021	Giving them more funding and autonomy would help a lot. Also, broadening the definition of political intimidation would allow these agencies to charge people who engage in political violence with more than just property damage, and illegal entry. It would serve the same purpose hate crime laws, even though actions defined under hate crimes are still illegal if it hadn't been motivated by prejudice.	I just don't think we need even more laws for this. We have laws and agencies devoted to this. The FBI has been warning about this stuff for YEARS.  We need to start listening to them and taking action. Passing more laws isn't going to help IMO.	I think something that Biden could pass with bi-partisan support is an Anti-political violence Bill. A law that would increase funds to FBI agencies investigating potential cases of domestic terrorism, increase the sentencing minimums for those engaging in political intimidation, and increased punishments for those who engage in property destruction and rioting during political demonstrations.

Hint: Regulatory burden.	why doesn't someone in Europe just start a SpaceX style company using the same approach to lean manufacturing and design?   government funds aren't going to help them claw their way out of this. European governments should be giving the funds to European space startups with this philosophy.	As a European I agree that we should to the same as the USA for military launch  Which includes a computation so we can get a new player in Europe, because arianespace is acting in the same way as  Boeing/ula  They saw the writing on the wall and did not reacted And now they are waiting for ESA/EU to pay the bill	Most of Europe doesn't even allow model rocketry.

I don’t agree with their methods at all, but they do have legit grievances.  There’s no meaningful far-left in America. Most Americans still think Bernie and AOC is as far-left as it can get, even though their ideas are pretty tame by the standards of any other developed democracy.	To clarify, you mean you thought that the super far-left in the US was crazy, or the far left in Germany (e.g. Die Linke)?	I think I moved further left. I was a liberal Bernie voter in America. I didn’t want anything further left than his policies, though. Now I see him as more of a slightly-left moderate.  When I first moved to Germany I thought the super far-left here was absolutely bonkers. It’s so good here. Why become so extreme?

But im certain that was not the case. We lived in a house of horror with tons of unexplained activities. My mother reached out to our local church leaders to assist us with the problem.  They advised us to vacate the property which prompted my mother pack our things and leave in a hurry taking nothing more than our clothing.

There are plenty more of these encounters that I can share with you guys, but this is by far the most traumatic of them	 I hesitated to respond to this but . . . What you are describing with your hypersexuality after a mysterious incident sounds much more like *textbook* childhood sexual abuse trauma then paranormal activity. Have you explored the possibility that this was a real person who did this to you and your mind replaced the image with a paranormal entity to spare your developing brain?	Right? There's so much she could have hidden to protect OP in a way, plus I wonder if OP was drugged and of course doesn't notice bc they were a small child.

Many of the statistics are specifically about women, even the take away message at the end is about “dieting girls”. This tends to make many guys think that IE is for females and just brush it off.   I’m not saying that women shouldn’t be targeted, I just feel that if there were *also* some material out there targeted at men then we’d reach a lot more men.	Interesting feedback!  As a lady Im not sure Id be able to catch language that was written or targeted towards my gender.  Can you elaborate?  Genuinely curious and want to understand your experience.	I welcome another male! I also used to be heavily into macro tracking. I agree that most of the IE community is female, but I think the only reasons for that are because:  1. Most guys into dieting don't even know they exhibit disordered eating habits. 2. A lot of language around IE is geared towards a female audience which can put off some guys that look into it. Kind of a circular effect.  I wish you luck in your journey. If you need another guy to speak to PM me.	Thank you for responding!

You might be interested to know that scientists believe that the DNA for having live children using placenta (rather than laying eggs) might come from a mutation we acquired by assimilating ancient viruses into our DNA. In fact, there are lots of pieces from ancient viruses in our DNA. So, to answer the question, yes it is in fact possible to have positive benefits from viruses,  but it's weird and rare.  https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/endogenous-retroviruses/	Im just curious if things like in the movie spiderman, where a spider bites a boy and gives him superpowers. Is that possible?	Well as I understand it viruses want you to have symptoms because these symptoms are the means by which a virus spreads. A virus actually doesn't want to kill you. It wants you to be alive, spreading it through coughing, sneezing, etc. It doesn't really make sense for a virus to give you "positive" effects...does it?	That is just so cool. Such interesting stuff!	0

Those who dont believe there should be consequence for things they've said (which is uncomfortably common in this sub)  That they arent 100% consistent with their enforcement of the TOS.  ETC. ETC.  But I think it really all comes down to ppl failing to realize the internet isnt their small community.  Fb, Twitter, reddit, and so on are a new from of interaction and for whatever reason - more than a few ppl treat them like a personal place to state their beliefs. ... to the "world".  YouTube practically created the flat earth movment we know to this day. And now society is starting to grapple/react with the complexity of what these hosts mean to social interaction.   Imagine the friction that going to cause when you come back to ppl like the flat earthers and finally have to... you know. Bring them back to reality	More like guns don't kill people, people do.  It's a forum people used it, that's all.  These people already existed and found a place to express their views nothing more. That's not YouTube's fault.  You can't police free speech.

gjf0tur	Anyone else pissed at Epic Games regarding Hitman 3?	Lying implies prior knowledge. IOI might have found out *today*.	IOI is not *also* at fault, IOI are the **only** ones who should be held accountable for this. They straight up lied to their audience when they announced that the Epic Games exclusivity would still allow steam players to carry over all Hitman 2 levels at no extra cost, and they lied about every location having level 20 mastery.  I love Hitman and am very excited about 007, but IOI really fucked up here, and if they don't get their act together and make some Battlefront II sized changes, I may not buy another IOI product for a long time.	IOI are also at fault you know. They had ample time to address this and waited until last minute. The way they're handling some things is pretty ridiculous.	I personally believe breaking a promise constitutes a lie regardless of the circumstances. There are certain times when it is more forgivable, but it is always a lie.	0

When he was writing an article about crunch he went on this weird blocking spree.

gjfl2q3	There's no guarantee that if/when Hitman 3 comes to Steam you'll get the levels for free	&gt; weary   Did you mean wary?	> Basically every EGS exclusive game was announced for steam within the final month of the exclusivity. Or they had the steam page set up for months but its just said "insert year" or something.  This is true, and Steam won't let you put up a store page while the game is for sale on another platform anymore (but not for sale on Steam). So I still fully expect the game to come to Steam. I'm just weary of everyone speaking about that as if it's a fact when things that have *actually* been promised ended up not being true.	Basically every EGS exclusive game was announced for steam within the final month of the exclusivity. Or they had the steam page set up for months but its just said "insert year" or something.  After they took this deal to get more money. They'll also get a higher cut per sale and also now we have to pay for the old maps??

gjgx4mm	I found this when I was digging through old photos	It reveals a disturbing lack of self-awareness (or is it just plain dishonesty?) that modern right-wing pundits want so badly to claim Lincoln and deny all historic ties of the American right with slavery, Jim Crow, etc. The same people would all have been the ones fighting for “states’ rights (to enslave black people)” during the time that Abe Lincoln was a Republican. The same states that most reliably vote Republican today were all the ones who formed the confederacy. Thus the idea modern Democrats are the party of the KKK and modern Republicans are the party of Abe Lincoln requires us to conclude the values of rural and urban America completely switched which makes zero sense. The same pundits who push “the party switch was a myth” expect us to conclude something even more ridiculous.	Everyone forgets that the parties switched too. The democrats were CONSERVATIVE at the time. Always drives me bonkers people dont understand that. Lincoln was progressive as shit if he was alive today he would be considered a democrat.	None	You hit the nail on the head... I believe it’s dishonesty plain and simple. Generalizations and the lack of any nuance when it comes to this plays a part as well. I don’t know if some of the people that watch said pundits have the intellectual capacity to understand it any deeper than the word Democrat or Republican	0
gjgyapj	WTF is the woke endgame, anyway?	A very medieval Catholic feel to it. Infighting, heresy, crusades, and constant guilt.  Mind you, I just crushed an Umberto Eco novel, so that might have something to do with my thoughts.	Its pseudo-religious, so the end result would be some sort of woke theocracy	The point is relentless unbounded critique. There’s no clear framework. It’s technically actually an illiberal philosophy, but also very individualistic. It’s clearly not socialist, nor conservative. I can’t really pinpoint it.	Medieval Catholicism had a much richer intellectual history than this.	0
gjhef3z	[Warning - Long!] My WFT 2021 Offseason Wishlist (Incl. Draft 2.0)	Ah, third rounder it was.    Weird to talk about BPA in a mock draft in January anyways, especially for a win-now team who desperately needs certain positions	The second pick was a safety/slot corner. Furthermore, you don't just draft positions of need because you need them. I was going with best players available at positions that need talent. It just so happens that this draft class is stocked with LBs and DBs and we have needs there as acknowledged by Rivera	Spend the top 3 draft picks on defense? Switch at least one of those with a QB or LT, preferably both, and it seems like a good offseason	In my first mock I had us selecting Christian Darrisaw OT from VT. If he's available (he's not projected to be) he would probably be my pick over JOK (and I am SOLD on JOK :D )	0

I think more series can stand to vary themselves up on the linearity/exploration spectrum.	I prefer variety, it's the spice of life	I don't want linear 3D Mario to die though.

gjimijh	Even if Bowser's Fury is extremely short and simple, I'm excited about what it means for the future of 3d Mario	That's totally fine. I personally think Odyssey's actual followup will be Odyssey 2 on the Switch. But like I disagree with having Galaxy 3, I wouldn't want Odyssey to become a permanent standard. There's room for change in both linear and sandbox-style 3D Mario.	Maybe a hot take, but there's been an abundance of linear Mario of late. Between the Galaxy games, 3d games, and all the NSMB games, Odyssey's the only real "exploration-focused" Mario game we've gotten in like 15 years, bringing the number of sandbox Mario games to a whopping 3 in total.  As someone who personally prefers the 64/Sunshine style of play, I'm glad for any nonlinear scraps they're willing to throw my way. Linear Mario games clearly aren't going anywhere, and there's already so many of them as is that I find it hard to be bummed Bowsers Fury looks to be more than yet another "just get from point A to point B" batch of content. I waited ages for Mario games to revisit the open-ended format, so it's nice to see that side of the series hasn't immediately gone into hibernation for another decade or so.	I don't want linear 3D Mario to die though. Not that I hate mini-sandbox 3D Mario either; the two should coexist or at least alternate.  Honestly, I'm not so sure about 3DW's Switch expansion being yet another mini-sandbox. I kinda wish it was a bunch of linear levels instead.	None	0

Rich kid, parents supported him well into his 40s, decides that since he's got a disposable income, he'll just cosplay a migrant farmworker for the summer in order to feel more connected to the land and his people.

gjnct5t	Does anyone else feel like they got kicked out of the Christianity subreddit?😂	People with those beliefs are welcome to participate, and so are the people who believe those people are wrong. r/Christianity is not designed to be a safe space, but they do not ban people for being progressive. Safe spaces are a good thing to have (obviously, or else I wouldn't be here), but not *everything* is going to be a safe space. I don't agree with the persecution complex idea that r/Christianity bans progressive users because they don't. They just let homophobes, transphobes, etc. be there too.	Anyone is welcome to participate, but dont express any kind of belief in progressive Christianity or infer that the Bible is anything but a complete roadmap for living your life.	Have you actually gotten kicked?? What happened?  I just looked it up and their description says that all are welcome to participate. So if that’s the case looks like another classic instance of Christian hypocrisy to me ¯\_(ツ)_/¯	Which is kind of what I said.	0
gjnxkx2	Dealing with Ommetaphobia after a PRK surgery	No I meant indication. As in you should have previously worn contacts before they would consider letting you have laser eye surgery. But as I said it was my assumption.	>I kinda thought having previously worn contacts was an indication for the surgery  Or do you mean contraindication? Like if you wore contacts, you wouldn't be a good candidate.	I’m not a doctor but I kinda thought having previously worn contacts was an indication for the surgery. I guess I had assumed it because my surgeon had ask extensive questions about my previous correction history, including whether I had previously used contact lens, for how long, and why wasn’t I happy with just using contacts etc. I got the feeling from him that he didn’t do laser eye surgery (due to inherent risks with any surgery) on anyone until they were sure contacts weren’t for them.	Ah I see what you mean. That's honestly great your surgeon brought that up and wanted to make sure you had fully explored the non-surgical alternatives. Looking back I definitely should have experimented more with different types of contacts, brands, dailies, etc. before getting surgery.	0

Resorted to asking the internet because my surgeon does not pickup the phone on weekends. I was concerned & wanted to see if anyone had a similar experience so I can be put at ease while waiting to call my surgeon. Thanks for the advice.	Call your surgeon if you are unsure of anything, that’s why they give you their private phone number, don’t ask the internet.	Um no. I don’t think most surgeons give out their private number.	0

For example the okara (soy pulp left over from soy milk production) is usually sold to pig farmers. Is the soy milk vegan or not then?	Easy to avoid non-vegan companies, pretty hard to only shop at vegan-only grocery stores.	How far you going to take this line of reasoning? If you take offense to products from producers with other unethical products, how can you for example justify shopping in regular grocery stores? They profit off of all of these products. Taken to the extreme, can you even shop anything? Most produce is grown with animal manure, and farmers are usually members of trade organization that gives aid to other farmers.   Following this line of reasoning makes life impossible. What's important is that you drive demand for vegan products, and that's entirely sufficient. Don't feel bad.	are there vegan uses for leftover soy pulp or would it be preferable in your opinion to dispose of it at cost	0

People don't always accept compromise. There were obviously people who thought that the Federation *should* have fought, because they genuinely believed that long-term peace with the Cardassians was impossible.	Yes, but how did they fail to effectively communicate this fact to their people not just the average Joe/Jolar on the street but to long service Starfleet officers.	I assume they just did what they had to do to end the war with cardassia. Relocating some colonists seems to be the lesser evil when compared to thousands or millions dying in combat.	They weren't wrong though. Long-term peace with any militaristic government is impossible. The Cardassians only sought true peace when their world had been obliterated and their ruling military class all but wiped out. There's a lesson in there for anyone still defending the US military budget.	0

These companies can afford to pay their workers more and choose not to. Shame on them.	The $2 increase would be nice, but what this grocery store worker would prefer is the vaccine.	None	None	0

gjqvpnc	This is just a castration waiting to happen	The issue isn’t that people wouldn’t *want* it. I’m sure there are people out there who want to fuck with their balls. Or for whom it would provide a good option due to their disability. The issue people are having is it wouldn’t work.	You guys don't realize that products like these are often made for people with disabilities. Why would you need a testicle penis if you already penis? Well truthfully, you don't. But what if you didn't have a penis? What if you had a partner you still wanted to please? You can use your mouth and hands, but I'm sure that doesn't remove the desire for PiV for the couple. I recall a man who had his penis removed due to cancer in the sex subreddit.  Edit: I am not saying its a good idea or product. I am not saying this anyone's best option. But as someone who's not disabled, I'm also not about to make fun of it. I think we should always be working towards more options for disabled people	None	Again, I'm not arguing the product is a good one. I'm just seeing a lot of people asking "why" and unusual, seemingly impractical products usually have the same answer: they are aimed for people with disabilities. Snuggies were for people in wheelchairs; anti spilling contraptions are for people with tourettes, parkinsons, and many more; those stick on eyebrows everyone was calling ridiculous a while back were for people with cancer or alopecia, etc. etc. I'm not commenting on its efficiency whatsoever.	0
gjqzim0	Most minimal way to install Wifi in 2021?	Same here with sound.  Used plain ALSA for a while. Always scared to change my audio hardware configuration. Then would run into problems with stuff like Discord and the odd game that things like apulse couldn't resolve.  Installed PulseAudio not long ago and _it just works_. Likewise pavucontrol.	Minimal is great until it isn't. I messed around with minimal wireless managers for too long now I just install Networkmanager on laptops and my life is easier.     Just thought I'd mention it.

gjr0fns	I’m new and I’m the worst person in the class	Yeah cardio is the one area where I feel as though CrossFit workouts don’t put up enough consistent demand to build and maintain your endurance. Especially at the beginning. So far it’s helped me a lot to do some cardio on my non CrossFit days.	When i started out what helped me was between the training days i scheduled longer cardio sessions so that i can keep up the pace in the crossfit session. I struggled a lot with getting to the end.   Also very important after training days you need a good long sleep for regeneration. You will get stronger over time if you stick to it, dont worry	None	None	0
gjr54tl	Any ADC stereotypes you got? On your team or enemy team	I like to say that Ezreal is a champion that requires the ability to hit skillshots, and use fast reflexes. And if you're playing below gold, you have neither.	I saw that meme that was like playing Ezreal because you land skill shots? Nah, play Ezreal to always hear the enemy team tell you GG and I think that sums it up nicely	50% of the time if I see an ezreal on my team it's because they're autofilled and want to play safe. 45% of the time they're just a coward and want to farm for 30 minutes and hope someone else on the team carries them. Only 5% of the time are they an actual good ezreal.  I once asked this subreddit how best to support an ezreal, and the overwhelming advice was to dodge. In low elo, someone locking in ez is like admitting they're comfortable with losing lane.	For some reason the best Ez plays on my team have always been midlaners and I assume they’re possibly mage players who realized the team needed either more AD or stronger poke/aas, and do well. The ones I play support for often have no idea what they’re doing too	0

Previously the QB coach in Seattle, Canales is expected to get some NFL OC looks.	If he's been our passing game coordinator, I'm very unimpressed. We have the most vanilla passing offense in the league.	Does anyone here shitting on the guy actually know anything about his offensive philosophy or?	None	Russ talks about this guy in just about every press conference, I could see him being Russell's choice. Maybe don't scrap the whole playbook but just build on it with ideas they've already discussed.

In 1962 burgundy is 40% german. I imagine by 1981 burgundy would be majority german and the reich would directly take it over as a result	None	Not really that far fetched when you consider Burgundy is literally an "assimilate or die" state. Historically, racist states usually just enslaved their undesired populations, in fact, Nazi Germany in TNO did that to Russia. But in Burgundy, if you refuse to speak German, you'll most likely get killed eventually.	0

gjsgm6f	The Pandemic Bike Boom Is Here to Stay: Activity and sales data suggest that there are still more cyclists than ever before	Also, are people going to stay in proper cities?  With remote work being normalized, what's to stop people from moving to far cheaper suburbs and exurbs if they don't have to commute to work?	I think the extent to which it is here to stay depends a lot on how cities reallocate space on their streets. Most people are not going to be comfortable riding in 30 mph traffic, especially as more traffic returns to the roads. Those cities that already have good cycling infrastructure, or have managed to improve it during the pandemic, may see a more sustained boom, as the people giving it a try are more likely to stick with it.	None	I don't know. There are still tons of jobs that are not suited to remote work, and people who do not like it. I think that, while you may have some employers/employees switching primarily to remote work, others will see the available space and fill the void.	0

Im not sure that anyone says that the Chiefs arent a kansas team.  I think that there is frustration that Johnson County taxpayers dont want to share some of the costs for a team that most of their residents root for.  Its disappointing that right now as we are seeking to defend our super bowl title that this sub cant get over what state we live in even though we all root for the same team	Fuck anyone who says the Chiefs aren't a Kansas team too.

gjsx4wo	Second playthrough, built the entire highway before reaching the Timefall Farm; I love this game	God I'm not sure, there was something screwy with my timer somewhere along the way.

Definitely I would say if you're going for 100% you'll be at it for a while, there's a lot of busywork to do if you want to.	how many hours did it take you more or less to do all those things? Im hoping to make my playthrough as long as humanly possible, im on chapter 8 with 10 5 stars, many 4 stars, and about 40% of roads built, 120 hours approx. Can I still make this a very long and fun experience?	I've been doing a second playthrough of Death Stranding and have been checking off as much content as possible as I play. I've done 96 Legend of Legend S-ranks so far, have 5-starred every settlement up to and including the Distro Center South of Lake Knot, and have completed the entire highway.  I didn't actually intend to do the whole highway before moving on, but it just sort of turned out that way since it was taking so long to extend the road in the Mountain Knot region with only a long-range trike that the MULE camps would constantly respawn with materials, haha.  This game is excellent and a second playthrough with better knowledge of how everything works really makes the whole experience great. Keep on keeping on! 👍	None	0
gjsxcwb	Gender Swap One Piece Characters	I'm aware that this is just a joke question, but to answer seriously anyways:   Hypothetically, R63 Sanji would probably have no such rule in the first place. Canon Sanji gained his "no harming women" rule from Zeff, whose reasoning was based on sheer tradition regarding gender dynamics (think of the reason a typical old man or Gen Xer would give for not hitting women).  Zeff probably wouldn't care to give R63 Sanji that kind of rule since Sanji would be a woman and thus would be all clear in his view to hit another woman, and there are no mainstream gender traditions that discourage the hitting of men, so Zeff wouldn't have that kind of rule either.	I think genderswapped Sanji would be the most interesting. Would she refuse to hit boys?	None	None	0

gjt9z6j	I need help best explaining to an employee why calling others ‘sweetheart’ and ‘hun’ in a professional setting isn’t OK.	It depends on the context and tone. If it's not said condescendingly, then I think there's definitely people who don't mind. Honestly, I loved being called hun, sweetie, etc. as a teen/in my 20's by older women. Felt comforting. Maybe that's because my mom and I didn't have the best relationship, though.	I dont think so. Im 33 and from the Caribbean. Its a normal term used by our people & now that I live in America - Im realizing this is not used by them. Its such a common word that I never realized how uncomfortable it makes people. Will definitely try to stop	None	I really agree with this. I'm in my 40's, from The South, and it is entirely a matter of context. People want to hang their hats on this "It's condescending!" thing, but it truly is sometimes almost automatic. I'm a professional and I certainly reign it in, but I've slipped up in public and said "sweetie" or "sweetheart" to very young people assisting me, usually in service roles, or to my children's friends, and it was absolutely out of genuine affection. I've also called people 20 years my senior "sweetie" or "honey" so I'm not ageist about it. The "Bless your heart" is played out, and I don't think it would fly here in Austin, but people really shouldn't be so cynical as to assume that any shred of human decency is dripping in sarcasm. That said, it isn't appropriate in the office.	0

I didn't and that's why I enjoyed my 100% playthrough.   I went in expecting nothing of the promises, and enjoyed my experience, despite the state of the game.  It's not like over-promising is unheard of or uncommon, among many AAA titles.  Anyway, even if I would have considered the game complete garbage, which I don't, I wouldn't have asked for a refund. I don't ask for refunds, I'll just add it to my library and not play it.   I've made plenty of misbuys in my life, and I didn't go and bitch about it every time.   That's called taking your lumps. And maybe next time, don't believe the hype. Take it as lesson.  Because that's how I arrived here, by believing the hype on another project, another time, and getting burned. And again, and again. That's why I enjoyed myself here while so many of you are now butthurt instead.	None	0

gjtrgtr	How can one get closure after realizing AN?	&gt; Belief in closure, to me, is just another delusion, like belief in God, family, work, etc.  To me, it's similar to "the meaning of life" or "justice" or "happiness". Sure, we can rationalize and put systems in place to limit the harm caused the absence of such things, but there is no reason to believe that the universe gives a shit about us or owes us any of those things in the first place.	The Efilists here are probably more likely to agree with me on this than a large portion of Antinatalists but, depending on the reason why you arrived at AN, I don't think you can get closure.   Not if you got here through suffering reduction ethics and have an understanding of the psychological mechanisms used to ensure the continuation of the Human race and the DNA within.  Once you see that anything that you attach to for 'closure' is essentially just a trick your psychology and ego is playing on you to ensure that you stay alive and don't decide to kick the bucket, any closure that you find will be hollow and meaningless. Belief in closure, to me, is just another delusion, like belief in God, family, work, etc.   Obviously someone may be AN and not believe in the psychological aspects I mention above, but I do, so for me at least, closure seems like an impossibility.  However, I don't think that this is a good reason to reject the philosophy. Personal happiness =/= truth.	None	None	0

I don't know why the update is so slow, but I can guess at when it's coming.  Official Stadia support for the CCwGTV is "first half 2021" and Android 11 on Android TV has improvements that seem relevant to cloud gaming like low latency media decoding.

I've been a programmer for 20 years and I know almost nothing about machine learning.	Machine learning logic is math,  Converting it into coding is programming.  However, when people say they work on machine learning, most of the time, they really mean they are feeding data to a black box and consolidate results. It’s is the easiest part to be honest.

If that's your thing then go for it but I think you would be happier as a PA.	None	None	0
