f82bqaw	Nobody is jealous of childfree people.	This isn't really a conclusive study. Over 2000 subjects vs the millions who are parents in western civilisation.	[It turns out parenthood is worse than divorce, unemployment  even the death of a partner](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2015/08/11/the-most-depressing-statistic-imaginable-about-being-a-new-parent/)	None	[deleted]	0
f82kxzj	Nobody is jealous of childfree people.	Are you childfree and happy?	Except you dont speak for everybody, and yes many people are jealous of child free people.	None	I could answer that, or just reiterate that my point stands regardless.	0
f837nmy	Nobody is jealous of childfree people.	Love how the childfree loonies downvoted us	R/childfree should be classified as a hate group.	It's truly bizarre. They're the MGTOW of the parenting world.	Yup no rebuttal or anything like that just downvote where I can pull dozens of post with an incredibly amount of hate as my proof	0
facnqaa	If you don't wash your hands after using a public bathroom, you should be fined.	It's not being overly dramatic, its telling people to take 20 seconds of their time to take care of their personal hygiene and be considerate of others.  You say its overly dramatic but would you like it if you touched all of my shit particles and got ill for Christmas?	People should stop being so overly dramatic about this.	None	I'm pretty sure I'm already touching alot of shit particles in my life. Money for example are dirty af. Do you wash your hands every time you touch it? And for a record - I wash my hand after taking the shit, but I don't absolutely care if anyone else does.	0
facrnqh	If you don't wash your hands after using a public bathroom, you should be fined.	I'm so glad that I'm not selfish	I'm so glad we don't have germaphobes in charge.	None	I guarantee you that unless you're anti-vax, you won't get sick from my unwashed bathroom hands.	0
fazrsf5	You're not judged for being childfree, you're judged because you're an asshole about it.	Both are just as bad as each other.	This can be reversed very easily and in fact I see this attitude a lot more with parents then people without kids.  Also in service jobs parents are almost always the biggest fucking nightmare to deal with while single people or childless couples are always much easier to deal with as a whole.  Also who makes fun of people for not having kids lol? What a strange little bubble that is.	None	Yeah but dogs are a lot more tolerable then other peoples shitty kids.	0
faztg2d	You're not judged for being childfree, you're judged because you're an asshole about it.	I mean, don't have kids if you want but unless you have brothers and sisters, you are literally putting an end to your family so he isnt wrong...	Me, being childfree, never talking about it unless asked  My dad: OMG YOU'RE LITERALLY KILLING THIS BLOODLINE! *cries*.  Tell me again how childfree aren't judged for just existing.	None	Whoa whoa whoa..,you start a rant about how shitty childless people are and then you’re going to give this person a lecture about ending their family gene pool? Maybe childfree people are just shitty towards you because you say shit like this.	0
fazuvp3	You're not judged for being childfree, you're judged because you're an asshole about it.	Yeah, no one cares about other peoples' children even though theres literally dozens of charities for sick kids and outrage whenever a child is murdered   I think a lot of people are just upset that children in general are cared for more in society than them and I used to feel like that until I actually grew up a bit	You know whats worse, parents. No one else besides your family cares about your child. A lot of parents think everyone should care deeply about their children but that is simply not the case.   Society revolves around families with children and rewards them with tax breaks and incentives.	None	You went extreme, straight to the sick kids.   I’m thinking more of when I go to a restaurant that is not catered to families, there is not even a children’s menu and yet all these parents come in with screaming, out of control children. I am sorry, if I am paying a decent amount for a nice night out why should my night be ruined cause you have an out of control child.   But I am sure you will turn that around and act how high and mighty you are cause you “actually grew up but.” If that was true I think you would of learned not to be so condescending.	0
fcs7n2c	Live shot of being the Third Wheel	My girlfriend always gets upset when she wants to be intimate in public or when friends are around. I don't mind handholding or a quick peck but otherwise not much into PDA. I understand that she's proud of me and of us being together and wants to show the world that, and so do I. But despite explaining to her multiple times, she still doesn't understand why I'm not comfortable with PDA. Happy people can be the cruelest, and by God have I hated happy people in the past. Don't want to be those that I despised. You don't know what people are going through. No need to flaunt your blessings to the bitter and broken-hearted.	Been in this situation many times. A great many times.	None	You ought to be married to my wife. She doesn’t like any kind of PDA.	0
fcuf1st	ULPT How to “pass“ a police interrogation	&gt;Yes but you won't be able not to talk to investigators at all. At some point you will be questioned.  No, you can literally not talk to investigators at all. That's the whole point of the "right to remain silent" in the Miranda warning.  You can provide your personal identifying information and not make a peep the entire time. Informing them you'd like a lawyer is courteous and to your benefit but, again, it's fully within your rights to say absolutely nothing.	Yes but you won't be able not to talk to investigators at all. At some point you will be questioned.	How to 'pass' a police interrogation:  Do none of the above, invoke the fifth, and ask to have a lawyer present before further questioning can take place. Anything else you say CAN AND WILL BE USED AGAINST YOU.	The lawyer part is just to make sure you don't say anything stupid. Those blooficers can be mighty convincing after sitting in the room with you for a few hours.	0
fdkv5u9	Fish oil has a powerful mood stabilizing effect on me	Don’t give up your antidepressants for (snake) fish oil	Very interesting. I'm on vyvanse for adhd and lexapro for depression ... my therapist has been suggesting I start taking a mood stablizer due to some depressive or manic episodes that suddenly occur. Fish Oil sounds like an interesting alternative. Really don't want to take another med. Thanks for sharing	None	Never seen a person with so many down votes on their comments loll.

fdkw1vf	Fish oil has a powerful mood stabilizing effect on me	Dr. Rhonda Patrick told me. She has the mice studies to prove it!	> You have severe uncontrolled prolonged systemic inflammation  Wow, a wizard doctor with a perfect diagnosis over the internet! You're amazing!	You have severe uncontrolled prolonged systemic inflammation, which the immunosuppressive effect of fish oil dampens. Basically the same "benefit" as salt restriction is supposed to have. But when looked at from a larger perspective it is just symptomatic relief that makes the underlying problem worse.  Anhedonia / not caring / lack of emotion is a defining effect of stress metabolism, achieved by serotonin which is powerfully raised by PUFA and especially fish oil.  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3914521/	None	0
fdkx2nt	Drinking freezing cold water as cold shower substitute	Behind cold showers? There is none that I’m aware of.  Immersion therapy is usually colder, longer and more immersive than just a shower.	What's the science behind cold showers?	Whenever you drink very very cold beverages, your core does indeed increase in temperature to heat the water back up, but the effects are short lived and not that much heat is being made. Cold showers are more effective because you exposing yourself to cold water all over skin (the largest organ) especially because humans have a high concentration of cold receptors in the forehead, chest, balls. However, there is even some research showing that cold showering arent cold enough to reap the benefits of cold shock proteins.	None	0
fdp7x7z	Increasing the feeling of "wakefulness" through habit and lifestyle changes?	dopamine desensitization isn't a thing	Sounds like a dopamine desensitization issue.  I used to have low energy and a general blah anhedonia feeling. I think I've achieved what you're describing to some extent primarily with the following:  * Exercise 3-4 times a week. * Trying to get a full 8 hours of sleep consistently and trying to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day. * More whole foods, fewer processed foods, and less sugar intake. * Blackout curtains and sleep tracking app. * Getting out in nature more often and away from TV, phone, computer, etc. - so-called "dopamine fasts" seem to be a popular move nowadays. * Dopamine receptor ~~upregulators~~ modulators like cordyceps and uridine.  EDIT:  I suppose "modulator" is technically a more accurate term for those compounds, as some here are blowing a gasket over the term "upregulation."	None	None	0
fdpvilm	Sick	I’ll definitely think about the coworker advice. It’s weird because she is usually supportive and kind but she will sometimes do weird and uncharacteristic stuff. It’s easier to avoid it now that I know she will do it. With the barista thing, it’s Mississippi. The state could care less and wouldn’t take it seriously, and the police are corrupt. I’m trying to find a job that I enjoy doing but I’m not quite there yet. This is definitely a motivator though. Even though I know toxic people exist in every facet of society...	I understand not being able to report your coworker, I also find myself in a similar situation although in a different context. You have to make the choice: if you do end up talking to HR, you stand up for your beliefs AND show everyone else they shouldnt fuck with your food. Another route is talking to that coworker, which I guess is not too viable. You should also ask yourself why you would want to work in an environment that is so toxic you cant even report the toxicity itself; this is not necessarily just about this incident, but it can effectively loewr your quality of life significantly in many contexts.  Oh, and what your barista did is borderline illegal. Especially if youre in the UK where you can now claim religious discrimination.	None	I’m sorry that you find yourself in this situation. It sucks to see people who are supposedly your friends turn on you for your ethical beliefs. And of course it sucks to not be taken seriously by your government. I hope you soon find a solution in a job you like :)	0
fdpvlg5	Sick	Definitely. I’m just glad it wasn’t egg because I do have an allergy to that. 😣	The worst part of that is that those two bastards could've potentially endangered you, especially the barista. Imagine if you had a dairy allergy and drank that shit, you'd be fucked up.	None	None	0
fdpvtcf	Sick	Because yesterday they accidentally made my drink with cows milk and I asked them to fix it. I was very nice, no fuss. When I walked away tonight with my drink I heard him mumbling under his breath and I felt weird about it. When I got to my office and tasted it, immediately I knew it was whole milk. 🤢 I try not be paranoid so I shook it off until that first sip and I knew I was right. People are weird. But I can easily bring my own coffee from now own. It just sucks. Mississippi is so backwards.	I cant understand why a barista would even do that. They certainly wouldnt pull that shit with someone that was lactose intolerant. What excuse did they give you? And do you have other options nearby?	None	What a small-minded and petty idiot. They obviously don’t want your business so give them the finger.	0

feecfgr	Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has pledged to donate 1 million Australian dollars ($690,000) to help fight the country's wildfires, which has drawn criticism from some who say the donation is meager in comparison to his net worth.	The problem is that on r/politics, if you're wealthy you're apparently an evil, conniving person who deserves no less than a summary death sentence, and no behavior can save you. That's what I've seen on here, anyways.  The problem with this kind of black-and-white thinking is obvious, in that there's a massive difference between people like Tim Cook of Apple and Bill Gates. But the modern "hip" view is to 'eat the rich' (I've heard my coworkers use this phrase unironically), whatever that means.  Also people don't seem to understand that while Jeff Bezos has a net worth of 120 billion, he doesn't actually have that number in his bank account sitting around doing nothing. It's the value of stock he owns. Which means that giving a million dollars to any cause is a pretty significant event, even for the wealthiest man in history.	You motherfuckers, he donated $1,000,000 to a good cause, no strings attached, and yet you're still unhappy because he didn't give more. That amount of money will go a long way to helping people recover.	None	Not to mention 30 years ago Jeff Bezos was just like any other ads hole on the street. He wasn't born into his money, it wasn't given to him, he actually earned it from starting his own business and making smart financial decisions. And the fact that he uses his money to improve the world is a good thing	0
feiu3fw	Another example of cognitive dissonance from a farmer. The calf is cute and fluffy until it’s time to kill it unnecessarily to eat and use its dismembered body parts. Makes me sick to my stomach. 😣	Yes.  I commented on their post “It’s just sad that as soon as the cute wears off she’ll end up in a slaughterhouse 😢” And she commented back “Medium rare with sweet potato on the side 🤩”	do you know theyre going to kill it for a fact?	None	WHAT THE FUCK  Like imagine you have a friendly and polite conversation with somebody and then they calmly shoot you in the face and walk away without a second thought...	0
feybcki	Vegan Response to Piers Morgan (Food language, new court ruling, vegan steak bake)	I know, most people don't agree with that assessment outside of libertarian or freedom minded philosophies.      Spitting on someone should always be illegal though, not just for certain groups. Point being that if an action is wrong it's wrong because it's targeted at a person. The specific grouping of that person is irrelevant and giving our politicians full control over what constitutes a "valid" or "invalid" grouping is begging for inconsistent and arbitrary law leaving some people behind and lifting others to a higher status, enjoying laws that aren't available for everyone. This is both a legal mess and in my view violates basic human rights of the freedom to choice.     And yes, discrimination is choice. They are the same. You discriminate every single day in almost everything you do. It's a part of being human. You shop at certain stores, not other. You eat at certain restaurants, not others. Pick certain people as your friend, not others. These are normal choices and most people agree that they ought not be controlled by law.     Now, what about some other choices that are not so kind, good or nice? You can pick only female room mates when renting out a room. You can deny any job you want based on any criteria you want even if the reason is that your boss is black. You can refuse to hold the door for black people. You can have zero gay friends, actively deny that you want anything to do with any person who isn't straight. So where do we draw the line? At what point is should your choice be illegal? Should we make an excel table and pick the good and the bad ones? How will that work when we have a hundred million scenarios to judge?     It's not an easy question to answer. Trying to decouple some of these choices as "invalid choices" and some as "valid choices" leaves us open to a legal mess that I alluded to earlier and the only sound way of dealing with this is to not make it a legal issue at all.   Laws were not intended to handle all wrongs in society. Sometimes societal pressures and civil and voluntary interactions is enough to sort out an issue. And sometimes it's much better idea.     And legislation also leads to the problem of hidden prejudice where people who want to put up a sign on their business saying "we only hire white people" can't do that. So now we don't know that they are a racist establishment.      Exposing bad ideas is the best way to get rid of them, not hiding them or making the illegal.	> Legal protection for what other people say and think about you? No. Discrimination laws are terribly unfair, uneven, arbitrarily applied and goes against basic human freedoms.  Im sorry but i dont agree. Legal protection will save individuals from harassment and being discriminated against. I rather the law protect me than being spat on by someone who is extremely anti vegan. Its the same as gay people being discriminated upon just because they like their same sex.	Use any meat language all you want. No problem.     More vegan options are awesome!     Legal protection for what other people say and think about you? No. Discrimination laws are terribly unfair, uneven, arbitrarily applied and goes against basic human freedoms.	None	0
ff3gaqw	Phones, laptops, TVs etc. What’s your stance?	Tomorrow's technology builds on today's.      So what do you mean?	Sure, but we're not there yet. So in the meanwhile buying these has a negative impact	Is technology a net positive or net negative? You seem to just assume that it's a negative and I wouldn't agree that it's that simple. I am convinced that green technology will be a huge part in us dealing with climate change, pollution and natural disasters and much, if not all of that technology will be based on discoveries from other technologies, like tvs, phones and computers.	Its great and all, but its not an excuse to call buying current electronics a good thing.  You can't buy more meat saying its for future techbology. Advancements are great and all, but thats not changing the current situation yet	0
ff6iyxd	How would you answer someone who asks/tells you to kill yourself because of your viewpoint on birth/life?

ff6jkcm	How would you answer someone who asks/tells you to kill yourself because of your viewpoint on birth/life?	&gt; Plus the whole self-preservation instinct is pretty strong.   True.

ffcvsfi	Going Vegan doesn’t solve climate change?	Capitalism brings wealth; wealth brings consumption;  consumption brings environmental impact.	Veganism doesn't solve climate change because altering ones individual consumption package isn't an effective way to tackle a systemic problem like climate change. It is overconsumption driven by capitalism which is the problem.  Having said that animal agriculture is hardly a small part of global green house gas emissions, the UN puts it at 14.5% and a lot of that is methane which has up to 28x the warming effect as CO2. Beef cows account for 45% of that and milk cows 26%, so its actually over 2/3rds not 1/3rd.	None	Under capitalism the means of production are owned privately and run for private profit. In a market system the price level determined how much of a good will be produced. The price level is determined by a negotiation between producers and consumers. However, not all individuals negatively effected by the production of a good is represented in this negotiation. Thus their interests go undervalued. This produces negative externalities, negative products of production unaccounted for by the price level which leads to the good being produced above the socially optimum level. This is made worse by the fact that producers, capitalists, are a small and wealthy proportion of the population sheltered by their wealth from most of the negative externalities. There are also few producers then consumers and so producers have more market power. Thus, under capitalism production is largely determined by a small group of individuals motivated by short term private profit leading to massive negative externalities. The only way to adaquetly address this problem, to internalise the externalities, is to democratise production, i.e. Socialism.	0

ffdv672	How can anyone think that animals don't have souls?

How does anyone think souls even exist?	based on zero scientific evidence. i just believe we have souls.  unlike believing in religion though, believing we have a soul hurts nobody:)	0
ffj9xgz	Vegans...How would you get the vitamins you need if you lived in the 1800’s before supplements? Also would you use horse carriages or just walk everywhere?	poop	> And even today you only need b12, which, thinking of sanitation levels back then would have been plentiful.  What kind of lack of sanitation would provide plenty of active b12?	Probably would have been vegetarian as meat was not common for common folk, hard to get and you can't hunt the King's forest and your live stock is taken away as a tax payment. So maybe some eggs and milk would have been available, but mainly beans, bread and cabbage. Such was the life of common folk  Edit: and noone says that the common folk were not malnourished. And even today you only need b12, which, thinking of sanitation levels back then would have been plentiful.	None	0
ffll9lt	We (vegans) need to realise not everyone else can realistically be vegan.	Stories?	It is backed by many, many stories of people who struggled on a plant-based diet.   Using phrases like backed by science makes things sound factual and black and white. But we dont know everything there is to know, and we certainly dont know enough to dismiss peoples experiences just because we dont fully understand the reasons why.	>The truth is everyone is different and all our bodies are different and everyones nutritional requirements and experiences are not the same, whilst some people can thrive on a plant-based diet for decades it is clear to me that just as many people cannot, and begin to suffer ill health after just a few.  Honestly, I'm disappointed to see this from you. I've really enjoyed your contributions to the sub, but this just ain't it. I'm very empathetic towards the impoverished people (think single mother with three kids and two jobs) who are too time poor to cook rice and beans and can't take the time to wade through the bullshit and get educated on nutrition, but the idea that any significant percentage of the population can't thrive on a whole foods plant based vegan diet is just simply not backed by science.

ffuzdtc	Well, at least they are honest.	He is replying to a post that says that having children is 100% selfish and narcissistic. At some point OP insinuated that those who have children do it because it makes them feel special. OP wants to see any arguments for the contrary, but the user commented that he simply didn't understand why the OP was seeking an argument for it being a selfless act and that all he wants is a future caretaker basically.	The fact that they are perfectly fine with putting another being through all the shitstorm in life, just to one day take care of themselves is actually a clear sign of narcissism though, i dunno what hes talking about.

ffx8ryu	Everything is equally weird - On Graham Harman's philosophy	Love the voices and art, but might you have a version without the dramatic soundtrack? I'm finding that somewhat distracting.	A brief overview of Graham Harmans weird realism and his object oriented philosophy (OOP). The video explores some of his core concepts that are present within his more general philosophical claims. From flat ontology to his notions of real and sensual objects, but not without skipping the undermining, overmining and duomining notions. The material is introductory, so there might be some oversimplifications. But, I hope it gives a more general look at how OOO-ists think, and how one can think with Harman's OOP in particular.	None	Thank you! I was expecting the voices to be the BIG problem. I could have sent the image without the voices haha. Unfortunatelly, there's no version rendered without the SFX and music.

fh2m9u1	What are some common logical fallacies *we vegans* fall into? Let's strengthen our logical reasoning proactively!	But then you start a different debate altogether about the existence of God.	Religious arguments are particularly easy to rebut. Just ask for academic sources that offer empirical evidence for the existence of a deity.	I think the argument that most vegans fail to understand is the one related to God and religion. If we get into the nitty gritty of things then you can absolutely justify eating animals in the presence of god in the equation.	Again, asking for empirical evidence or an academic source should cut those short. That was the point I was making.	0
fh2mmul	What are some common logical fallacies *we vegans* fall into? Let's strengthen our logical reasoning proactively!	Because dairy, egg etc. industries are inseparable from the meat industry and involve cruelty in themselves. It is not right to rape a cow every year to get milk out of it until it becomes useless in 5 years at which point it is sent to a slaughterhouse; it is not right to separate a cow from its child; it is not right to make chickens live in miserable conditions and kill male chickens because they become "useless." How can you even propose such a thing?	I think the biggest problem you guys have is when you equate caring about animals with a choice to not eat them. Animals eat other animals. We are animals and it's natural to eat them. You have to remember that you are the radicals and this lifestyle is only attainable for people with the financial comfort, time and patience to choose it.   Advocate for eating less meat, ethical treatment of animals, impossible burger type stuff that actually tastes good, etc. Stop trying to cram it down our throats with guilt, because that will never work.   Also, seriously, why would you ever be vegan and not just vegetarian? Most of you are liberal and support abortion rights. Eating an egg is the same thing, as there is no harm to a nonexistent life. You're just depriving yourself of nutrition and enjoyment of this world. My 2 cents.	None	None	0

I mean, I have never seen any anti-capitalist movement that have been kind to animals or humans for that matter.	I am an atheist and pro-choice but I'm not anti-human, my veganism stems from my belief that all humans are morally important and deserving of respect.

Destroying property and such is fine, but outright threats to the people involved I see as a little harmful.

fj98ujz	Tesla big battery's stunning interventions smooths transition to zero carbon grid	Should we believe your dad or MIT? Sorry try again.	My dad working for ABB at the time sold a solar power plant in the 1990s to a major nation because Nuclear would have cost way more per MW of output. Solar and batteries are now many times cheaper and way more efficient since then and nuclear has become more expensive. Your links looks at the cheapest nuclear ever built... before we had environmental regulations and investment problems and public relations problems. We can be 100% renewable with batteries before we could overcome the public relations problem with nuclear. If we managed to overcome the PR nightmare of nuclear then we would have to change regulations and then convince investors... more years lost... Even in my poor-ass neighborhood I see solar panels going up now. Solar with batteries is close to being cheaper than any possible centralized system could match... It is already happening.

You have to open your mouth and talk, which is all "game" really means, is being a good conversationalist, being interesting, engaging, and let's not forget that fortune favors the bold : if you don't approach you have %0 chance.

fkbftjc	Panpsychism solves the hard problem of consciousness by defining matter's intrinsic nature - science will only ever tell us what matter does, not what matter is: Philip Goff	I don't see what problem it solves.

fkdohxa	Panpsychism solves the hard problem of consciousness by defining matter's intrinsic nature - science will only ever tell us what matter does, not what matter is: Philip Goff	"Simpler" in the unkind sense, then - fit for simple people.	It's "simpler" in the sense of you just say, "consciousness exists in all things, the end" and clap your hands.  It leaves all kinds of problems and doesn't really explain much of anything, but I guess it is "simple" in a sense.   How does rain happen?  Simple, it's the angels crying.  Much simpler explanation than water cycle and all that.	He calls it "solving" the hard problem when really all this approach does is to recharacterize the hard problem and leave you exactly as clueless as you started about what consciousness is and what its relationship to matter is.  It has no explanatory power or insight whatsoever.  I further take issue with his second inference:  "A simplicity-based inference – Once we accept the hypothesis that brain states have a consciousness-involving intrinsic nature, panpsychism is the simplest speculation about the intrinsic nature of micro-level properties."  Since there is no evidence either way isn't it just as "simple" to posit that consciousness arises as an emergent property of certain configurations of information-processing matter rather than an intrinsic property of all matter?  I'd argue it's simpler and more intuitive, in fact, but at the very least I see no reason whatsoever to prefer panpsychism as being somehow "simpler."

flv48qz	Two months ago, a spookily prescient thread was posted: "How would Anarcho-Capitalists and Right-Libertarian deal with a disease outbreak?" Have people's answers changed?	CDC (and WHO) pandemic response was gutted by a gang of capitalist clowns , kleptocrats and ideologues. Private companies can make faulty test kits, like they recently did,  A chinese company sold test kits with an 80% error rate to the Czech republic and they had to be returned. Similar story with Spain, who had to return test kits as well.  Whats to stop people from reselling used masks (a chinese woman in wuhan was caught trying to resell used masks) or fake cures which kill people (there have been many), people being told to inhale steam, drink tanker cleaner, bleach, rubbing alchohol, use a malaria drug, hiv medicine, bear bile.  And then there are the companies who advertised the use of a temperature scanner, which we know back from the SARS and Ebola epidemic that they are practically useless, especial if there are asymptomatic carriers.   At best this is an argument for more effective government, not 0 government..	So let's review the facts here.  1. In the USA, COVID-19 testing kits were ready to be manufactured en masse by the private sector, but the CDC said "*NO! We will make the kits ourselves because we don't trust you*." Well, the kits, didn't work well and the CDC cannot simply make more of them anyway because of red tape regulations. 2. Private companies could manufacture testing kits if they get an emergency permit from the CDC to make the...which still takes 6 months to a year to acquire... 3. So the feds in the USA essentially converted to a limited, Anarcho-Capitalist model by telling private companies "*Just make the testing kits now and worry about the permits later*." 4. Pandemics cannot be prevented under societies with a government, thus it's ridiculous to demand pandemics must always be prevented under a stateless society. 5. Pandemics can only be addressed with less government regulation in order to be market reactive.

fm36l7e	In 40 years, less than 10% of plastic has ever been recycled. PBS/NPR report reveals plastic industry lobbyists knew all along, but pushed recycling propaganda campaigns to sell more plastic.	&gt;Covid19 is just a little hiccup by nature. The payback by nature for all the waste we created will be worse and lasts longer!  There will be no "payback by nature", that's ridiculous. Nature is a million interconnected systems, not a monolithic being that will suddenly stand up Transformers style and start whooping ass.  What's going to happen to the planet is that either we reduce the waste that we create as a species, or we won't and some species will evolve for that changed world while others die out.	Good God, it's worth a chuckle finally somebody, writes a realistic report about plastic recycling. After 40 years, known for a long time recycling is a sham made to feel good for the people. The sad reality is consumerism is not viable! The plastic industries need consumerism in order to survive so do the oil producers. Imagine if we changed things, no more plastic wrapping of stuff when going to Canadian tire, etc. Plastic parts that last a lifetime and repairable the horror of it to the economy! Want a wake-up call go to wrecking yard start adding up all the waste the cars create at end of life. Covid19 is just a little hiccup by nature. The payback by nature for all the waste we created will be worse and lasts longer!	None	So, doom and gloom either way.	0

fpnhyiu	The sex offender registry should only be for people for individuals who pose a risk to the safety of others. Not some 16 year old who sent a dick pic!	Is exposing yourself a sex crime?  Because that's what the street posters are charged with.  If they kept it in their pants and pissed on themselves in the street or wouldn't have been a sex crime (might still count as being a public nuisance but that is a minor crime).	Pissing on the street should never be considered a sexual offense.	Kids under 18 definitely should not be arrested for distributing that! They should be properly educated that that is not appropriate. I am glad that my parents and my school took time and effort to explain to me that child pornography is sick and should not be produced.   Also people who piss on the street should only be put under sex offenders if they are sober. How many people do stupid stuff when they are drunk, especially when you are walking home and are desperate. If you piss your pants, I think it is even worse than doing it in the bushes at night.	I think showing someone your penis in public is in the same category as sending a dick pic. But peeing in public is not inherently sexual, though I concede that someone could manage to make it sexual if that's their intent. Context would be needed to determine if the act were sexual by intent. Being able to see a penis is not, however, inherently sexual.	0

Some representatives represent twice the people of another, yet they both have the same power.	What's the point of having people vote, if Representative votes override it?	I think he has a lot of support that our demographic doesn't see. Many of his more stalwart supporters are not vocal online about their support. Many are only online in weird little Facebook groups. Also, he did not win the popular vote, meaning more ballots for Hillary were actually cast (but our REPRESENTATIVE democracy has always been screwed up, so he got more representative votes, in a way). Lastly, we all chug down cable news like Guyanese kool-aid, and with similar results.	None	0

fw0ghdb	Ignore the charlatans who say clean energy is too expensive	Whose is they? If you’re referring to Germany, they increased and renewed their dependence on coal and gas. California has merely outsourced their fossil fuels from neighboring states. Denmark makes use of hydro and neighboring countries as a battery. I don’t see how your explanation is relevant to any of the aforementioned countries and state. The high costs associated with wind and solar is primarily due to the physical limitations of both technologies. That being Intermittency/production variability, low efficiencies, and the diluted nature of wind and sun rays.	Specifically because as they increased wind capacity they divested their fossil fuel infrastructure, built unreliability into their system (wind generation doesn't have to mean stop using all other forms of more reliable energy, renewable or non-renewable) and had to buy power from neighboring generators at premium prices.  The costliness wasn't because of wind power per se, rather designing a poor overall system.  And as others are pointing out, so much more focus has been on ways to store energy to smooth out the supply curve.	[If Solar And Wind Are So Cheap, Why Are They Making Electricity So Expensive?](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelshellenberger/2018/04/23/if-solar-and-wind-are-so-cheap-why-are-they-making-electricity-more-expensive/#5990f3d51dc6)  Denmark, California and Germany all demonstrate that major expansions of industrial wind and solar results in increased electricity prices.

This waste needs to be stored securely for thousands of years. It's an ever growing pile of waste, that we have absolutely no plan for besides dig a hole and hope for the best.	None	Proven? Then why didnt nuclear dominate the last 70 years of energy production?  The only reason it ever was around was thanks to government needs (Nuclear material was needed) and heavy subsidies (direct and indirect ones).  Nuclear had it's chance and didn't take it.

fwtoff5	Germany is first major economy to phase out coal and nuclear	You’re right but hydrogen can be combined with ammonia and stored as a liquid rather than a gas. https://energypost.eu/green-ammonia-can-replace-fossil-fuel-storage-at-scale/	> But the head of Germanys main miners union, Michael Vassiliadis,  welcomed the decision, calling it a historic milestone. He urged the  government to focus next on expanding renewable energy generation and  the  use of hydrogen, which is being touted as a long-term  replacement for natural gas.   Hydrogen should not be considered for a fuel source, it is difficult to produce, it is difficult to store, it is incredibly dangerous.     The most cost effective method of producing hydrogen is extracting from natural gas (where does all the carbon go?)      Hydrogen is the smallest atom and just leaks out of everything.      It needs to be incredibly pure for hydrogen fuel cell use.     it is extremely flammable and reactive.      Anyone who is promoting hydrogen has a hidden agenda or is not well informed.

Philosophically speaking, when there is an ethical dilemma that is being discussed, "mind your own business" is generally a poor argument in cases where there is a victim involved. Like an abusive husband telling an outsider to mind their own business when confronted about his abuse. When your business directly causes suffering to other beings, others might be morally obligated to make it their business. Their goal isn't to piss you off, it's to help the victims.	I wouldn't make any points at all, beyond "mind your own business."	None	I was being a bit facetious when I implied "mind your own business" was an argument. (I thought my facetiousness was obvious.)

I’ll only be drinking *light* milk, thank you very much 😌	I would totally suggest going against the baby steps method. It's totally unnecessary and you are still contributing to what you have issue with.  4 1/2 years ago I watched Dominion. I was horribly ashamed of myself and walked into my kitchen with a garbage bag and threw away everything that wasn't vegan.  Honestly it wasn't even difficult. Sure I missed a few things but I survived just fine on spaghetti and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for the first two days until I figure it out a new shopping list.	Just take baby steps.

g12d87s	Is PETA Wrong Though?	&gt; pretending that the flu is in any way comparable to zoonotic illnesses that ravage populations every few years  Hot take bro	It is a little silly to imply that veganism could prevent pandemics, though, and I get how that might come off as preachy and tone-deaf. Obviously the initial source of COVID was from meat eating, and I don't deny that meat eating in general is a risk factor for a lot of diseases, especially when you take into account the near existential societal threat of antibiotic resistant bacteria. However, what truly made COVID so dangerous was the interconnected nature of our modern world. It doesn't matter if the pathogen comes from an animal, a human, or the mold under your kitchen sink. As long as transmissive illnesses exist, and as long as our society is globally connected, there will always be pandemics.	This has gotta be the tamest sign I've ever seen someone get upset about. Meat eaters really do have such fragile egos.	The flu is also zoonotic, though? Honestly I don't think you guys understand what that word means. "Zoonotic" doesn't mean "can only be contracted from animals", it means "can be spread between people and animals"  &nbsp;  Also, you can't *honestly* believe that transmissive illnesses are only a problem in human society because of meat eating, right? Like I've literally had other commenters criticize me for insinuating that anyone would be dumb enough to make that argument.	0

g1cr5cc	What makes the unborn "innocent"	&gt;Wasn’t the fetus forced into that situation  Depends on what you mean by "forced"  If we were to say that the fetuses life begins at conception and should be recognized as a human being, this would mean it was "born" with what is essentially a severe birth defect that requires another human beings body to survive. This isn't anyone's fault, and certainly shouldn't require by law another human being to sacrifice their body in order to keep another human being alive.	Wasnt the fetus forced into that situation?

The woman shouldnt be forced to attach herself to the infant. But this thought experiment doesnt represent abortion **at all**.  this would be more accurate to describe abortion:  A woman gives birth to a sick infant and decides to attach herself to the child. 2 weeks later she changes her mind and wishes to detach herself from the child. She takes a knife and cuts the childs throat to free herself.	None	Because actual abortions are directly responsible for the death of the child.	0
g1dbtru	Thought Experiment: A Infant With A Condition	But in this case, it would be actively killing someone wouldn't it? The infant is already attached, detaching them would led to their death?

Most pro-lifers would say that letting someone die is not the same as actively killing someone, so this analogy wouldn't help you that much.	None	None	0
g1nsyzh	A meat eater getting their animal products from well kept animals is more ethical than a vegetarian getting theirs from poorly kept animals.	In Belgium they can't even tell if it's beef or horse in your lasagna, so I hope noone here expects these labels to be properly controlled and enforced...	If you pay for your stuff you can make sure, idk what it's like in America but in Sweden we have something called "ekologiskt" which is a word  companies can put on their products if they live up to a certain standard that is regulated by the state. There is a company that I know of here that takes their cows to the slaughter house the day before they are to be slaughtered just so they can calm down over 24h and be at ease when they are to be killed.	How do you suggest people find out how well the animals are treated? I agree with the utilitarian aspect of your argument but I think the whole system is messed up, there isn't really a kind way to remove a calf from its mother or an economic way to kill an animal without it suffering so imo it's best to avoid the whole thing	None	0

g2pvaqg	Would you feel differently about abortion, if the death from it was passive instead of active?	Question for you. If a homeless gentleman broke to your home during -10F snow storm. Should you be allow3e to remove them from your home?	Not as an elective thing, not to be treated as normal or tolerable, when it's possible to have a living child delivered.   What we care about is not killing people, not the method.   Forcibly moving someone from a place they can live to a place where they will die and can't escape is a form of homicide.

Can you think of any reason why some state they can stay on the same dosage for many years and keep getting the same effect. While you and others experience the exact opposite.	I would say that is not a good move. I can only speak from my own experiences but Kratom loses its efficiency and you will need to dose more to have a positive effect. It does not keep working the same way long term at a steady dose for things like anxiety. It works best as spot treatment, breakthrough treatment, not an all encompassing solution. When you try to force it into that it slowly starts to not only not be up to the task but it’s starts to turn against you with the negatives outweighing the diminishing positives in an increasing fashion.	Thanks for the info. For me that would be great news. I am not looking for mood lift or euphoria in the first place. Can you point to any research on this or is this just you personal experience?	0

Like Lynn and revere , both fairly working class north shore towns, were within. a point even though markey lost, whereas in cambridge Somerville and amherst which are "the whole foods crowd" kennedy got blown out.  Kennedy underperformed what he would need to in Worcester even if he won it.

MA voter here....Just asking, how do you know that Kennedy, when elected will not advocate for your cause? Afterall, he also included his name in the letter? Since the 2 had admitted to having so much similarity in their platforms? It's not as if Kennedy will vote against something you care about?   Your post is really good, i learnt something new abit it didn't change my mind one bit. Sorry if i sound blunt, while it's good to know that Markey is an advocate. A Kennedy supporter could might also write a similar post the way you did about mental illness, Opioid addiction, transgender rights?   Do support candidates who are advocates for causes closest to our hearts. This race is close, think we can all take heart that  MA consitutents will be in good hands with either of them.

g6cqp5l	His porn preferences	Exactly - it’s pretty random.  More the reason for people to stay away from porn, who wants the sexual preferences to be shaped by an industry that just wants you to consume even more porn?	I might be searching for a deeper meaning that just isnt there	> I understand porn is normal  Just a program note - “normal” is a loaded term.  Being interested and curious about sex is certainly part of our evolved nature, but the technological ability to browse thousands of sex acts categorized by anything under the sun is hardly “normal”, and we as a society are reaping the consequences of this development.  Porn pushes people into weird places where they develop essentially random fetishes they never would have considered had not they gone down the rabbit hole.  So it’s not surprising your BF got into black/white porn, it could have been anything	The danger isn't about the consumption as much as it is because it changes (literally requires the brain like a drug) the expectations of how desire and arousal work.  If you look at the researched data on porn in the 80s and into the 90s, the "use time" was about 30 minutes... In part, because magazines, VHS tapes, etc. or having to go to the back room of your local BlockBuster.  And even "online" those clips were 30 minutes or so, usually with some kind of character storyline. Today with the interwebs and being able to switch channels or jump to another clip, that "use time" is less than 8 minutes on average, jumping across an average of 8 different clips, all of which might just be climax compilations and no context or storyline.   Translated...  One can get off in less than 10min (maybe even less than 3-5min) and can easily consume as many clips, one leading to another, as they want.  How can a human partner ever compete with that?  Arousal between humans takes longer, lasts longer and may not even be as "strong" at the end (versus "death grip").  *That's* why porn is dangerous... It's completely unrealistic when you try to apply what you've "learned" to an actual human relationship.	0

"Racists violate the principle of equality by giving greater weight to the interests of members of their own race when there is a clash between their interests and the interests of those of another race. Sexists violate the principle of equality by favoring the interests of their own sex.

g81ow7l	Marriage Vows Vs Dead Bedroom	I don’t think you quite understand how hard sex can for women when there is no emotional connection - it can feel tantamount to rape.  So asking your spouse to undergo what feels like rape is rather unkind.  Now a person can complain that maybe it shouldn’t feel that way and that’s fine, but that doesn’t change present reality.  The fact is that (with women particularly) the idea of “duty sex” is physically and emotionally repulsive, and potentially traumatizing.  This is true (and this is key), *even for women who wish it were otherwise*	Ok sure I see what you are saying, so if your spouse changes, and now only finds redheads attractive. I'm sure you won't mind them banging the new neighbor. After all they shouldn't be forced to honor promises made several identities ago. Yeah sure, just wake up one morning and say fuck you to your spouse, because I've changed... Right?	The fact is that people change over the years - what seems like a keepable promise in one circumstance might be very hard later on.  Does anyone really want a system where they are forced to honor promises made several identities ago?  It’s better to take people as they are - not how they thought they could be half a lifetime ago.	No, I think I'm being misunderstood. Let me share my circumstances. Married 34 years. Pursued relentlessly prior to marriage sexually. We bonded and formed our relationship with sex as a foundation stone. Ten years ago, a switch flipped, denial, manipulation, stonewalling, gaslighting, lies about why. Deadbedroom.I tried everything I could to take stress, pressure, work, hurt off of her shoulders. Nothing, only got worse. I was emasculated, broken, hurt. She refused counseling for years. I had nowhere to turn. I told her 6 months ago, we will see a mental health counselor, or a legal one. I told her that you cannot change the terms of our relationship arbitrarily. Tell me why. Let us work together to determine if we can both be satisfied in our marriage. We will both try, or I'm filing for divorce. I stopped initiating or asking for sex a long time ago, I came to the end, when she suggested that we schedule a time to be intimate. When she came into the bedroom I looked into her eyes, and they were dead, like the eyes of a doll. I got out of bed and refuse to touch her in any way, nothing! I'll not stay in a marriage where her needs will be met, but mine can't. I don't believe in forcing someone to have sex with you, but I also don't believe you have to stay married to someone who can't or won't.	0

If she starts doing the dishes and I don't notice, drop everything, and get to sweeping, sometimes it really pisses her off. I think this is common.   When I'm out mowing the lawn, there's 0% chance wife's gonna show up with the weed whacker and start edging. When I'm out chopping cord wood, she's not gonna come help move and stack it. And I never get upset about that. Maybe that's part of it. Don't know if your household works like that. But I never expect help doing the 'man' chores.	When you are at home relaxing and your partner is cleaning up around the house, just kind of taking care of business, do men not notice that? Or do they see it and think if they want help theyll ask me? My husband will help with anything I ask, and not give me any attitude whatsoever. Hes always willing to help. When I ask. He doesnt take the initiative and ask how he can help or just get up and start doing stuff. Or even say I am going to do the dishes later. Most of my friends and my sisters complain about the same.	None	You make a valid point. I definitely don’t help with most outside stuff. And he doesn’t want me to. However, if he’s working on stuff outside then I make sure to do stuff inside.

Add to that the fact that our society judges you based on outdated views of traditional masculinity. Guys in here bottle up a lot and they cannot express emotions as freely as women can.   Read what [this article, called Focus on psychiatry in Egypt](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/focus-on-psychiatry-in-egypt/E0E2677196B9F29E0D840989C741F8CD/core-reader), from Cambridge has to say about **Egyptian Men**  > Male patients showed significantly more hypochondriasis and anxiety on meeting people than females. This can be explained by the fact that men in our culture tend to somatise their psychological symptoms, as the latter may lower their prestige and degrade their pride, because of the belief that real men do not have psychological symptoms.

g8ffvtx	‘David Attenborough: A Life On Our Planet’ Is The Most Important Documentary Of The Year: By framing environmental destruction through Attenborough’s eyes and unique career, it manages to humanize an issue that can often seem distant and abstract.	I gave up beef entirely based on documentaries. Most days I eat no meat. Some days I eat fish and chicken but after seeing this, I'll be reducing that too.   After watching Earthlings, I switched from dairy milk to other forms. There is more variety, are healthier, and all have much lower water and CO2 footprint, and don't contain any pus and most have longer shelf life. I really wish the cattle and dairy industry would collapse and the marketers would get a hold of the alternatives.	Anyone else cutting back meat because of this?	None	Only thing I’d struggle to replace is cheese. Almond milk or soy is fine and I think there’s alternatives for yoghurt too.	0
g8fhgnr	‘David Attenborough: A Life On Our Planet’ Is The Most Important Documentary Of The Year: By framing environmental destruction through Attenborough’s eyes and unique career, it manages to humanize an issue that can often seem distant and abstract.	I got a different message. The message I got was "I've witnessed how much we've fucked the planet already. I've witnessed complete rainforests chopped down and reduced to scraps and monoculture planations. I've seen numerous species die off. I've seen how much land some animals need to survive and how much we've already destroyed or taken away from them. I've seen nature dwindle and wildlife become much harder to find..." followed by a relatively short message of a few innovative solutions.  What really shocks me is that almost all of the land animal mass on Earth is humans and farmed animals, and barely a few percent is taken up by all wild birds and all wildlife on Earth. Poultry outnumbers all wild birds on Earth by over 10 to 1 if I remember correctly. And of the biomass of mammals, approx. 60% is livestock, 36% is humans, and 4% is all wild mammals.	This man is exactly why centenarians are just fascinating to me. They are the last ones to know our planet like it was when it was mostly untouched and exploited by industry.   The documentary is basically him saying, hey Ive been a professional for a really really long time in this and I can personally tell you that from what Ive witnessed were fucked if we dont change right now.

Lady said no, she wanted fucks-ya balloons, fucks-ya plates and fucks-ya streamers.   I responded that I wasn't sure what she wanted but I didn't think we had it.    Lady asked do you have red balloons or purple balloons?    And it dawned on me.  She wanted fuchsia, not fucks-ya.  Told her that we had a wide selection of decorations and balloons in red, violet and purple shades.    So fucks-ya can fuck right off.	None	0

Egypt is a majority Muslim country,the recent events in France are a very hot topic in egypt,so technically he can talk about it,i understand if it made other members uncomfortable but that wasn't the purpose of the post.	Love your prophet on r/islam not r/Egypt. What do you think the comments on my post will be if I loved almighty Satan in a post here?	I see how it can come off as insulting but I am sure that wasn't the goal of it,it's probably bec of all the hate we saw on social media bec of the murder incident,but overall the whole boycott is made by news outlets like aljaazera taking macrons remarks out of context,probably to distract people from boycotting Turkish products.	0

gcjox47	Privilege	&gt;Phrase it however you want.  Sure: Some white people have some amount of privilege more than some black people some amount of the time. Just as some black people have some amount of privilege more than some white people some amount of the time.	White people have privilege. Phrase it however you want.	One major issue I have with the concept of privilege is that it is invoked (along with its corollary, marginalised) as one of a pair of rigid, binary states.   I think it is better to view it as being a continuum. For example, rather than saying that white people are privileged and black people are not, would it not be better to say that white people are *more* privileged than black people? That way we could even attempt to quantify the disparity, watch it close (or open) over time, and compare different societies as to the extent of the disparity? Is the gap between the wellbeing of white and black people larger in one society than another?	Compare them.  So for example, how often are cops racist towards white people? Like how often does a cop do something bad to a white person, because the person is white?  Now ask these questions, but about racism towards a person of color.  &#x200B;  A white person might feel much more unsafe in certain poor neighborhoods. Sure.  &#x200B;  If you break it down, I think you'll see that the privileges that white people have are more significant and widespread than those that people of color have.  &#x200B;  The privileges white people tend to have seem to involve positions of power more often, yes? Cops are more racist towards POC than white people, as an example.  &#x200B;  What's on the other side? Compare them.	0

Drawing the line perfectly at what organisms are sentient and not is unneeded to decide veganism is the morally right position. Pigs, cows, fish, etc, the animals most frequently abused and killed are undeniably sentient.	That seems unrealistic to me if extended to its fullest conclusion. If the line is that every ant with a brain is in the same ethical category as a German Sheppard or a dolphin, would't it be logical to criminalize the poor treatment of an ant? What am I missing?	0
gcxgkf7	South Australia will end its hard lockdown on Saturday night — three days early	Multiple theories about this - what we're being told is that they thought they were dealing with a super infective strain of the virus, so cases would manifest quicker so 6 days was all they'd need to know what they're dealing with.  What I (and many others) think is that they initially told us it was 6 days so people didn't freak out too hard, and then at the end of the 6 days they would add another week or two with maybe some of the harsher restrictions lifted.	Im still confused as to why the lockdown was only going to be for 6 days. Everything you see, hear & read indicates that the incubation period can be up to two weeks, hence everyone returning from overseas or who has any contact with anyone whos infected having to do two weeks iso. 6 days just seemed to be a weird choice.	None	Exactly, when they were first told that pizza boy only went in for a pizza and spent only like 5 minutes in the parlour and tested positive they thought that this strain was something extra contagious. Hence the immediate lockdown cos who knew how many other cases spread from not only the parlour, but to the secondary contacts of all the customers.   I think they said it took approx 3 days for the cases to manifest at the time(going by the current cases and what pizza boy said) hence the 6 days wouldve gave a chance for all the cases from the pizza joint to surface, as well as all the secondary cases that cropped up from those cases too, and then an extra 14 days of reduced restrictions to allow for the regular incubation period.	0
gcxgzqz	South Australia will end its hard lockdown on Saturday night — three days early	That's what the evidence suggested?	A bit more sensible. Cant believe people were behind this idea, actually thought there was a different strain	None	No, the evidence didn't suggest it. The evidence suggested that something was amiss and that the contact tracers had incomplete information. It is a huge leap to go from 'incomplete information' to 'covid superstrain', when there are no other examples of such a strain existing. The simplest, most straightforward explanation was that someone lied, which is what turned out to be the case.	0

gcy7h9s	Is Diary from very small farms where the cows are treated fine considered ethical?	What about eating thrown out meat in a dumpster? I see no ethical problem there, doesn’t harm animals.	There is no ethical consumption of non vegan food. It's juste a way of making the guilty conscience go away (sorry this may not be very grammatically correct, it's not my native language).	None	I personally wouldn't because I'm at the point where I don't consider meat food anymore, it would be like a last resort in case of apocalypse and even then I can't see myself killing an animal and just cutting it... it's just I don't have it in me. I guess it doesn't hurt but I would try to make it available for someone who may not have access to enough food or something. Would you really eat meat and not be disturbed that it is was alive? That's just too weird for me now but I guess everyone is different. Edit : I may consider eating animal products that went bad or eslse if I were homeless lr extremely poor too, but that would be out of necessity really	0
gcy86uz	Vegan foods with saturated fat?	I have a handful of studies suggesting SFAs to be linked to poor health outcomes so I’ll try to share those later. So if it convinces you then you needn’t worry about eating SFAs. You understand that it’s a nutritional consensus that SFA intake should be limited, right?  I’d think the fellas at that SF sub aren’t interpreting the science correctly/are cherry picking/are picking industry funded studies etc.	Thanks, good point about veganism. I think the other sub is indeed more up my alley.  Coconut SFA is unfortunately rather short (mostly 12:0), and doesn't get metabolized in quite the same way.  There's also cocoa butter, but that has its own exploitation problems, human this time :(	Coconut oil is vegan and high in SFAs.   Anyway, veganism isn’t in of itself about health or food at all. It’s about being anti animal exploitation. This question may be more received at the sub the other user mentioned.	Please do, I'd be interested!  For me, it doesn't make sense that saturated fat would be bad for us, since for example it's our main energy storage system. Excess carbohydrates get converted to SFA and then later partly desaturated by SCD1. We don't make any PUFA which is why they're "essential" (we get enough from diet to cover the small amount we need).  Cows even eat almost nothing but saturated fat, they ingest grass which is fermented into e.g. butyric acid and that's their main food source.	0
gd0itbz	TIL I learned that the United States life expectancy is decreasing.	There is something called the Hispanic Paradox. The poorer the demographic the less they live. For example African Americans are poorer than the general population and unfortunately live less. However, as you probably guessed from the name, Hispanics are poorer than average but live longer than the general population the US. Different theories as to why like healthy migrants, or they eat healthier diet (more beans in 1 week then Caucasians in a month), etc.	And Costa Rica in Central America now has a higher life expectancy than the USA.

gda8dr2	Daily Discussion Thread: 11/21/2020	The only thing that works for me is setting goals and attempting to build good habits while breaking bad ones. Positivity is helpful too but it's more for anxiety than depression or anger management IMO.  The only two things I've seen work for anger management are SSRIs (for my friend with very severe anger issues) and quitting alcohol or other depressants. Oh, and spending less time thinking about/reading about politics helps if you are politically inclined and feel constantly angry about it.	There seem to only be two ways to work through mental health issues, according to the internet  - "Endless positivity! Focus on the good, don't worry about badly vibes! Just constant affirmations and attention seeking, that'll help you!"  - "Don't try to 'fix' yourself when you're not broken! Put your diagnoses in all your social media and accept that it's your identity and everyone else is wrong!"  Which are equally rarted. FFS I just want to learn to stop getting mad at everything and these people are trying to get me to join their damn cults.  Oddly enough enough both cults seem averse to bodybuilding as a valid hobby too, didn't see that coming.	None	None	0

gdcetxc	How does marijuana use affect semen retention?	I used Marijuana in the past on SR streaks and it felt a lot more “spiritual” than when not retaining. If you can limit your use and not get too addicted, I think you can still enjoy it.   I quit weed then started using again a couple of times. But the last time I quit was 3.5 months ago I'm still struggling with awful PAWS till this day. I know I'm not going back to it after this experience.	So marijuana use wouldnt be advised?	It raises your vibration short-term and lowers it long-term. If you're already high vibration (higher than weed) then it will just lower it.	Marijuana, alcohol and other stuff can be used for spritual benefits, but they require an immense control over one's body and energies. Tantrics and Aghoris do use them for their benefits but they are very difficult to manage. Under good guidance they can do wonders for a person's spritual progress.	0
gdczrzf	People putting their pronouns in their bio is not nearly as annoying as people complaining about it	Kind of apples to oranges. One, subject matter. Two, a header/profile bio is the not the same thing as walking around with a big sign. In most instances you have to actively go to that person's page to see it, and you won't otherwise see it in a timeline/etc. view.	Ok, let's apply this to a different situation.  Somebody walks around with a sign that says "Hi I have an eight inch dick" *all the time.*  Does that *really* affect you? No. Do you look at it and go "Man, that's fucking stupid, what an obnoxious prick"? Absolutely.	Honestly I don’t see why you’d be upset that a random person has their pronouns in their bio?? Like dude it’s their account, they have the right to post anything and to put anything in their bio.	Subject matter is irrelevant, the point is it's two people announcing stuff that they don't need to announce.	0

ge2bo4i	TIL one theory for why we haven’t discovered extraterrestrial life is that Earth is early to the party. Over the next 100 trillion years before the last star burns out, 92% of Earth-like planets that could foster life elsewhere have yet to be born.	&gt;  has evolved multiple times here on earth  It isn't evolution that is the rare event, it is the origin of life before evolution even gets a chance to get going. Earth is 4.5 billion years old and life has only originated 1 time as far as we can tell. It could be the case that the origin of life is such an improbable event that despite a huge number of planets it just doesn't happen.	We arent even the only intelligence on planet earth, I think its silly to think its not every where. Sentience and higher intelligence has evolved multiple times here on earth - cetaceans, octopi, birds, primates, elephants. If octopi, birds, and humans can all use vastly different brain structures to achieve problem solving skills, I think its safe to assume intelligence is almost inevitable.	Rare earth theory: we are well and truly alone in the galaxy. And that's the scariest outcome of them all	We actually just found evidence of life on Venus. It’s not conclusive but we’ve now got seasonal methane blooms on mars and phosphine in the clouds of Venus right where we would expect to find life if it existed there. I’m just saying that if our two closest neighbors, formerly considered absolutely inhospitable to life, likely have life, I’d say life is almost guaranteed the moment conditions allow for it.	0
ge38r8u	Woulda been a good topic for Thanksgiving	Geography plays such an important role. There is a reason why the USA will always be a powerful nation and that is hugely because of geography. Meanwhile a tiny mountainous nation will have a very hard time.	What always amazes me is that people fail to take geography into account. Like sure its not medieval people's fault if they happened to settle near a volcano they didnt know about, or slaves that were taken to Haiti, or even if you were born somewhere bad but cant afford to leave. But when in my country a very middle class county got flooded (that was all a flood plain) really badly everyone said it was God's punishment for the gays. Like maybe just don't live on a flood plain if you can afford not to?	I had an evangelist tell me one time that the reason Haiti was poor and got destroyed by natural disasters is  because a few hundred years ago the people of Haiti committed a sin so large that their offspring were cursed by god.   I left that conversation confused and then learned ‘the big sin’ was actually the Haitian Revolution.	It's arguably population and geography combined	0

gep60p2	Which subreddit is worse in its hatred of low value members of the opposite sex: fds or whereareallthegoodmen?	&gt;Jaded women are more likely to be normies than jaded men, because women in general are more “normal”.  What the hell are you talking about? Dating is 100 times better and easier for the average woman than it is for the average man.   If a woman is dissatisfied with her experience of dating, then she is either significantly below average in looks, or significantly above average in cuntiness.   The average woman has no valid complaints about dating, whereas the average man has plenty.	There are no normies in that misogynistic sub, theyre incels. Jaded women are more likely to be normies than jaded men, because women in general are more normal. Women get jaded from normal dating, men get jaded from being rejected.	Hard to say because we don't know whether the demographics of either one are jaded individuals or just people who are there for the shock value.  If WAATGM is mostly normies who laugh at these ridiculous women and their expectations while FDS is mostly jaded women who are similar to the women that WAATGM laughs at, then you'd have your answer.

geq1nc9	Incel, Feminism and FDS megathread	Ironically, if Elliot Rodgers had survived his killing spree, he would have received more love letters in the next 72 hours than he would have in the entirety of the rest of his life had he chosen not to go on a killing spree.	I think contrary to popular belief among women that incels are violent, i think they arent violent enough. Saying edgy stuff on the internet hardly counts. I think if more incels were truly violent and truly embody this personality then they wouldnt be incels. I think the personality of a violent person would imply a sort of assertiveness, stubborness, and "get what i want" attitude that would be beneficial in avoiding inceldom.   I think the truth is most incels are passive, have lots of feminine mental qualities, and some are truly that ugly (but with these personality defects i mentioned). And women who think incels are violent are reading too much edgy internet stuff or cherry picking rare incidents on news (you only hear about the loud ones).

gerkk2e	Incel, Feminism and FDS megathread	Daron Malakian from System of a Down.  It's actually quite sad. There was a lot of drama that occurred between Daron and the other band members —supposed creative differences and power struggles. However, armed with the wisdom of the blackpill, it was plainly obvious to me what the drama was *really* about when I read up on it.  Daron founded SoaD and was their main songwriter, so he felt he was more responsible than his bandmates for the band's success. However, he is quite an ugly man, so obviously he was not reaping the rewards (ie, women) that his bandmates were.  Understandably, this caused him to feel great bitterness towards his bandmates. What man wouldn't? He was putting all this effort into the band and exercising his superior talent, yet he has to watch three other men reap the rewards of his hard work simply because they had "correctly" configured facial bones. He was effectively a cuck.  Learning about this was quite a blackpilling moment for me. It's crazy how you can be the primary creative force behind one of the most influential rock band's in the world, and yet remain worthless in the eyes of female sexuality.	Do you guys suspect some musicians were incels or have incel qualities?  I think Nick Drake was an incel musician. Friends and family have commented on never having seen him with a woman.   I think Kurt Cobain was another one, well wouldve been if it wasnt for his fame. In the documentary montage of heck a lot of his woes and complaints reminded me of inceldom.

gerrwby	Incel, Feminism and FDS megathread	It is of paramount importance that we dispel the myth that the privilege women enjoy in the SMP over men is merely that "old creeps" hit on them. No. Women are also hit on by average men, and even above average men, even when they are not above average themselves.  Whilst it may be true that women's extreme hypergamy often means even the average/above-average men are not true options to them, women end up settling down with such men eventually, so either women are en-masse settling down with men they don't really desire or they actually do experience tremendous privilege in the SMP.   Both things cannot be true at the same time.	Life doesn't get easy because you have more options in dating. Quite often you don't have or they aren't really options. I was mostly hit by creepy older guys during my teens years and my peers were ignoring me because I looked like a child. Do you think that being hit by creeps makes life easier?	How to date as a woman:  - Don't be fat   That's it. That's life on easy mode.	No, I wasn't claiming that all women are hit by old creeps. *I* was hit by them in my teen years and that was my point.

getbdoy	Why is there so much turmoil towards the pharmaceutical industry among the general public ? And do professionals in this field feel the same way about the field ?	Other countries don't have the problem but yet have the same industry.	They are the ones who created that political system though.  e.g. the pharmaceutical lobby made a huge effort on Citizens United, to make it easier for them to write their own legislation.  They can't pass the buck to regulators when the regulating bodies are revolving doors with pharma execs.	It's an industry like any other. The outrage is mostly aimed at outrageous pricing for their products *in America*. That's not the fault of that industry at the core, it's the fault of a political system allowing it. We don't suffer from that where I live, and we get our medicine from the same industry.   And you have to keep one thing in mind, development of medications is brutally expensive. That leads to another problem. The industry wants to make profit, and consequently directs their efforts at products that will sell well. Medication for rare conditions will never recoup the development cost and consequently don't get researched. That's another systemic problem.	Yes, because those countries battled and defeated similar private interests.  It's like if you were complaining about being mugged, so I said "you can't blame the mugger, just keep a gun in your hand like me and no one will mug you."  We agree that this problem can be resolved through legislation, just like you won't get mugged if you walk around with a gun in your hand.  That doesn't mean the mugger isn't culpable for their crime, or that the lobbyists and owners aren't culpable for theirs.    Pharma execs are monsters who have actively engineered unspeakable human suffering in order to enrich themselves.  They are absolutely accountable for that.	0

Medication for rare conditions will never recoup the development cost and consequently don't get researched. That's another systemic problem.	May I know why ?	0

gf4vqqi	Daily Discussion Thread: 12/08/2020	Yeah I'm a programmer (actual job title is "Software Engineer"), it's a good field if you can tolerate programming.  I don't have a great idea what it's like in Sweden, but I think the pay is pretty good there as far as non-US countries go. You can move to other countries (like the US, maybe even Hong Kong, Singapore, Switzerland, Australia, UK) pretty easily if you want; obviously there are lots of jobs in the EU too.  I actually don't mind sitting in front of the computer 8 hours a day (I then usually spend an additional 5-6 in front of it in personal time since covid started LOL) but I think you'll appreciate being able to do that as you get older. As long as you learn to sit with a good posture and walk around every hour it's very gentle on your body.  I don't find the work particularly enjoyable but it's somewhat stimulating and it pays really well in the US	I'm trying to choose what field i want education in, and right now I'm torn between programmer and electrician.

gf8mwza	[Q4All] Is one gender more likely to know their “league” in dating than the other?	&gt;*A person who has good thoughts cannot ever be ugly. You can have a wonky nose and a crooked mouth and a double chin and stick-out teeth, but if you have good thoughts they will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely.*  This quote is outrageously bluepilled.	I still have no idea where I belong, and doubt I ever will.   It's pretty easy to tell for other women, and men, like if someone would be considered a 3 or a 8 or a 5 by societal standards. Even I can make that determination, even if I don't personally agree with it. Also, the halo effect is real, so yeah, if you're attractive people, especially men, tend to be nicer towards you.   The very weird thing is that people are nice to me but I'm not hot, definitely not an 8, 9, or 10. So maybe it's kinda like Roald Dahl said;   *A person who has good thoughts cannot ever be ugly. You can have a wonky nose and a crooked mouth and a double chin and stick-out teeth, but if you have good thoughts they will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely.*  Perhaps this is a version of "game", except it's just being nice, friendly, and smiling/nodding at people so they know you've acknowledged them. So it's charisma based halo effect.	None	Well it IS from a children's book lol	0

gfnnvaa	Why are the "laws" of Gravity and Magnetism still taught in school if Einstein gave us a more correct understanding?	I think people don't realize how much we approximate in science when it is convenient and good enough. In my field, I did a lot of molecular dynamics on large systems. Everything is governed by harmonic potentials. Good enough when you don't stray far from equilibrium. No sense in complicating it.	Einstein gave us a better understanding of gravity so it shouldn't be taught?  What kind of logic is that?  If you are referring to learning newtonian gravity in school. this is why it's still correct. It's an approximation but a good one.  magnetism in turn has nothing to do with general relativity.  You shouldn't unlearn any of that.	None	None	0
gfosptu	What should you absolutely never f*ck with?	In an Irish pub, an American tourist asks if he can get an "Irish car bomb".   You can hear a pin drop. After a beat, the bartender politely says "yes". When he returns, however, he only carries a tall tumbler of whiskey.   "On the house, lad," he says "you're gonna need it for the car bomb".	A few years ago I knew someone who hit his pregnant girlfriend. Turns out she was the sister of an Irish gangster. The guy disappeared, rumour has it amongst the Irish community he was in a local canal. I had to persuade my mate to stop annoying them once, as they told me that he was getting on their nerves, and he doesn't want to have to teach my mate a lesson. I got on fine with the gangsters, so I was ok. Thankfully my mate listened to me and calmed down. He had a habit of pissing off people whenever I went to my local pub with him. I had to keep reminding them that I'm safe as, I'm 2nd gen Irish, and I'm not acting like an idiotic 18 year old, which he was.	Cartels or mafia.

gfp58j8	Ladies, what masculine qualities/male traits do you find attractive, and what are repulsive when it comes to dating & mating?	If that was true, then it wouldn't be the case that the men that get sex the most and with the hottest women (ie women with the most options) is men with Chadly facial structures. But it is the case.	As a woman Im gonna day from my personal experience with my female social circle- this isnt necessarily true and its one of the biggest myths of incel culture. Most women would sacrifice a chad facial structure in place of humility, a good sense of humor, and being interesting and intelligent. Look at Adam Driver, hes got a recessed profile and women adore him. I know a lot of women that would also totally date a guy like Seth Rogan.

gg1qqoq	I had a thought and want to know the scientific validity of it. Is it possible that the first living things did not have the desire to survive and it was something that was adapted?	I mean, if you don't reproduce successfully, you are gone. That's evolution in a nutshell. There are thousands, millions of dead end branches in the evolutionary tree. Sure. It just hasn't anything to do with will or desire. Just with maladaptation.	I think I worded it poorly. A bacteria does not have a will to live, but it does sustain itself and reproduce. There is no reason for it to do that. My question is that is it possible that there was a proto bacteria that didnt work and therefor died. Is the ability to sustain oneself just inherent to life or could it have been an adaptation?	The first organisms had no desires at all. Most organisms don't. Bacteria just work, they have no desire to live or anything. You are putting a human perspective on things that are neither human or conscious.	None	0

gg4shc3	Nice guy (beta) vs. bad boy (Chad) is the wrong distinction. It's the exciting guy vs. the boring guy.	&gt;the vast, vast majority of people are average looking, so the difference is in personality.  Such an offensively incorrect statement, and such a common misconception.  Even if we look at weight alone, statistically speaking about a third of the population is obese, another third is just overweight, and a final third is a healthy weight (with a tiny % being unhealthily *under*weight).  That means the difference between the 33rd percentile person and the 67th percentile person is the difference between an obese person and a healthy weight person, and only a third of the population is inbetween them.  So no, most people are **NOT** average looking. There's actually a very wide distribution of how good people look.	the vast, vast majority of people are average looking, so the difference is in personality.     Plus, *most women never make the first move,* so logically men who make the first move win. In other words, a brave personality on an average man maybe does not make him attractive, but at least it makes him ACTIVE.      OTOH, a handsome Chad who just sits meekly in the corner and does not engage is unlikely to get laid, unless he finds that one in a thousand woman who will just grab and fuck him without him doing any work. A guy must at least have enough personality to *decide to act* when there is an opportunity.	LOL @ pretending personality has a huge effect on women's attraction to a man either way.	not entirely relevant here. Of the 39% of the global population that is overweight or obese, most are 40+ and already paired up.     The obesity/overweight rates among people in the dating age (say 15-35) is far lower.     Besides, IF more people were to become overweight, overweight would become the new average, and thus considered attractive enough. AVerae, and attractive is a moving bar, depending on the local statistics. We see that exactly in obese populations (ghetto, white  trash communities, elderly communities), the mildly overweight man is a Chad if everyone else is obese.	0

Did you get this as a confirmed diagnosis?  To anyone questioning the validity of kratom affecting serotonin levels though, there was a study that found one of the alkaloids in kratom is an alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist, a 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, 5-HT7 receptor antagonist, and a D1, D2 receptor agonist.

ggcac24	What’s something you want to know about British people?	Broad leading context for each:  Git - has kinda a binomial meaning, usually a misbehaving child or an old person (often 'little git' or 'old git'). A very mild insult; if the Simpsons were set in the UK, Homer would probably call Bart a little git.   Prat, wally, plonker - usually when somebody has done something or is habitually a bit thoughtless or clumsy. Can be affectionate. Plonker is a little bit dated. A more ubiquitous equivalent of these could be 'doofus'   Twat - a little bit stronger, it wouldn't usually be appropriate to call somebody a twat in the office. Whilst there are exceptions, twat is usually contumelious and not said affectionately. It'd be like calling somebody an asshole or a jerk (maybe a bit stronger). See Danny Dyer complaining about David Cameron with his trotters up.  Berk - rare nowadays. Whilst the derivation comes from cunt, today it's ended up a more gentle insult and would probably be grouped with prat / wally / plonker.	prat, git, wally, plonker, twat, berk  are these all relatively minor insults, or should you have your fists up before you call someone any of the above?

He's been squeeing nonstop about how wonderful they are and hasn't mentioned feeling anything that would be considered a downside. I don't know if that was a new type of contact or something, though.  (Of course, I'm also sure that doesn't really help OP's question much anyway given either of those are repairing a *really* specific issue..)	Definitely a promising idea, but hard contact lenses are a pain (literally). My keratoconus patients only tolerate their rigid contact lenses because they are the only thing that lets them see clearly, and they know the next step is corneal transplantation surgery. For this to be widely adopted they will need to be soft contact lenses. I'm sure they'll get there soon though, flexible microcircuitry is a very active area of research.	I've seen a demo of this product, and it's pretty impressive: [https://www.mojo.vision/mojo-lens](https://www.mojo.vision/mojo-lens)  It's basically a hard contact lens with augmented reality heads up display built into it.

I think it's more basic than that. It's a matter of wanting to make sure that your beliefs are actually true, that they accurately reflect reality, over the desire to maintain your existing beliefs at all costs and never admit when you are wrong.	Exactly: it comes down to reason/science vs. faith.  When your thinking is based in reason instead of faith, then you don't assume you know everything about a problem, and you're always willing to examine new evidence, and change your judgment and actions based on that evidence.

gh5a5d6	Why do so some men on here believe that women not wanting to date or have sex with them means they hate them?	&gt;Wanting to genocide a whole population implies you hate them  Nah not really.  &gt;if you were indifferent towards them you would ignore them.  Are indifference and hatred the only two possible ways a persona can feel about a group of people? No.	Wanting to genocide a whole population implies you hate them, if you were indifferent towards them you would ignore them.	>If a woman sees a short or a balding or an ugly guy she feels a visceral disgust, a complete repulsion - she just doesent view him as human. If women could kill all short and ugly men in concentration camps they would do it without any thought or remorse. 0 empathy.  Nowhere in this statement is the claim made that women *hate* such men.  Feeling disgust/repulsion towards someone, viewing them as subhuman and having and the desire to exterminate them =/= hating them.	None	0
gh61yhq	Would the "rods from god" concept be as dangerous if launched from within our atmosphere?	It should be noted that in the Project Thor concepts, speed of delivery was the main factor. The yield of the proposed rods was not particularly impressive. Bunker-buster level, not even tactical nuke. Sci-fi tends to portrait the concept as overly powerful. It isn't. It's about being on target extremely fast, given sufficient satellite coverage.	The rods don't decelerate down to their terminal velocity. They hit much faster.  With many of them deployed in orbit you could potentially reach every place within an hour or less. Your bomber cannot do that (if you fly an aircraft, conventional explosives are better, replaces the lack of speed with chemical energy).	None	None	0
gh7sxrw	Religion and Trans-humanism merger in the coming future?	There's a few of those in this sub, but I can't see it becoming a mainline denomination anytime soon between the theological tossups involved and the fact that it's a fringe of a fringe in the first place.   (That said, a pan-Abrahamic unification is just Not Going To Happen Full Stop. That's only a possibility to people far enough removed from the religious world that they *can't*, much less *don't*, see distinctions between the various groups.)	Yea you are correct, but I could see Transhumanism-Christanity becoming really popular.	Religions merging almost never happens (See [Christian denomination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_denomination) for examples). Even when it happens, it has always been some tiny splinter group getting absorbed into one of the different large branches. There are christian and other groups that call themselves 'transhumanist'. But like other minor groups they can be safely ignored by their main organizations.    Most of the time, when a splinter is large enough to sustain itself, it simply becomes its own new branch. The type of person who becomes a leader of such a splinter is rarely the type of person who would give up power to someone else	None	0

Not insightful at all, just a useful method. A single paper is rarely pivotal, it's mostly a complex of ten or twenty of them.

ghhz3f7	People who lie about being raped should be required to register as a sex offender for life.	False accusations are only counted false if they are proven false, but any claimed rape that isn't punished is assumed true.  That's ab extremely biased comparison to make.  Comparing proven false accusations with proven rapes shows that false accusations are more common.  What do you think should be more common, people who lie or people who rape?  Also, false accusations made to others than police are never counted in these statistics despite being the more common form.  Funny how all the statistics seems set up to draw a very specific conclusion like some society level kangaroo court.	Absolutely would.   False accusations are rare. However, unreported rape is incredibly common.    It's absurd there are people more concerned with punishing women for false allegations, than they are encouraging the reporting and prosecution of rapists.	Considering how many rapists get away with their attack, I feel like this would backfire more on the victims	None	0
ghhzdfb	People who lie about being raped should be required to register as a sex offender for life.	Only because most false accusations aren't counted.	People hugely overestimate the number of false accusations of rape.  It is miniscule when compared to the number of rapes and sexual assaults.

ghhzizx	People who lie about being raped should be required to register as a sex offender for life.

ghs37m9	Daily Discussion Thread: 01/01/2021	Yes I quit drinking in November 2019 at 23 after 6 years of frequent binge drinking which caused lots of problems in my life. I am sober for over one year now. It was my third time quitting drinking. I failed the first time after 5 months due to FOMO and the second time after 3 months due to my "friend" pressuring me pretty hard to drink at his house and eventually relenting.  Unfortunately don't have any great advice about how to adjust your social life. My social life was good but not great from November-March. A lot of my friends were kinda drinking buddies that I've since interacted with less, but still had a good time with others; definitely had a hard time making new friends and finding non-solo hobbies. Then ofc coronavirus happened.  TBH I really miss how easy it made socializing for me, I just couldn't afford to make so many regrettable decisions or do/say crazy things anymore. I still get a lot of FOMO, although among my circles drinking pretty instantly became a lot less "cool"/fun after it was legal, mostly because it was no longer in the college setting. Definitely had the most fun when I was 18-19.  Feel free to PM me if you want. Also check out AA and /r/stopdrinking although I am personally not a fan of that kind of vibe, it is a little much IMO, but it can help when you're starting out.

But surely they are considered right-wing conspiracies?

gifjmwn	Is Sam really disproportionately criticizing the left or is he up to something else?	nicely put, I like.	I don't think there is any data on the subject, but I think it is clear that he does criticize the left more, as he should.  Harris is of the left, as are the vast majority of his followers ([89%](https://i.redd.it/u5bo9wxccxj31.jpg) of the subreddit, for instance).  Talking to people about problems they don't have is a waste of breathe.  If a team wants to get better they focus on their flaws and try to improve themselves.  Nothing is gained by simply criticizing the opponent.  People who want Harris to criticize the right more are those who have gotten comfortable in their little safe-places.  They want nice little echo chambers where they can bask in their perfect virtuosity, where in-group members take turns preaching to the choir.  I see no merit in such a practice.  These people can get this sort of self-congratulatory crap literally everywhere else, and they expect Harris to fall in line and he doesn't, so it infuriates these people.	None	None	0

giiwgd6	Is Sam really disproportionately criticizing the left or is he up to something else?	but upon closer listening, I think he is being sincere and truly cares about the left-center.	When people say that, they're not talking about statistics, they're talking about tone. His criticism of left and right are colored by the following:  1. Sam seems to get along with right wing grifters (like Shapiro and Peterson) while he always seems to be beefing with left wingers (like Ezra Klein and Noam Chomsky).   2. He's way more charitable to controversial conservatives like Charles Murray, whose views he spent considerable time arguing were simply misunderstood, than social justice movements, which he is quick to dismiss.   3. He often shoehorns criticisms of the left into his criticisms of the right, but not usually vice versa.  4. He's way more vague in his criticisms of the left than the right.

OP's almost certainly LARPing being a med student rather than actually being one, which seems borne out by the reactions they're getting in other subs.	As a transwoman I find a lot about this funny. What hormones exactly are you going to replace? If you don't replicate the "natural" cycle of hormone uptake and expenditure you're going to have effects on your body and mind that are probably the opposite of healthy. One of the major barriers in developing transgender healthcare was replicating healthy male/female secondary sex characteristic development - puberty. If you take too much too fast you can for lack of a better term overclock your body with negative health outcomes. I have to imagine you're not referring to sex hormones or at least not entirely - you seem to imply some odd cocktail of different hormones and intend to use them in a specialized way to redirect the aging of the body.

girn440	How should a dangerous research finding be disclosed or published?	Well, I'm actuaĺly not in academic research any more, I changed to patent law. To be honest, industrial espionage isn't taken as seriously as it should be. I have seen major industrial clients using abysmally bad data security when communicating with us.     Depending on the jurisdiction,  there can be an option to classify patents, though. At least in the jurisdiction I work under, patent attorneys tend to apply for a security clearance to work those cases. That said, I have never personally seen or worked such a case. And I have handled stuff concerning rocket fuels with military application - that still didn't get classified but published as usual.	What about state-sponsored industrial espionage?  China is notorious for intellectual property theft and cyber crimes to the extent that many western countries have raised alarm bells over the potential not only for in the context of unfair international trade practices but national security concerns.  Granted, private companies that have been targeted are less likely to participate in academic research and publishing in the context of OP's question.  But there are historic examples where developments in specific fields have been suppressed due to potential military applications, early general purpose computing being one famous example.  Speaking of encryption, there have been recent echos of the example I mentioned with the drive toward "quantum supremacy".  I wouldn't be surprised if current research isn't necessarily as "free" as we scientists are used to thinking relative to normal scholastic communications.	That sort of stuff is published like anything else. If a common encryption is broken, people need to know immediately, to switch to another encryption scheme.   You'll also see lots of high explosive compounds in the chemical literature, which is more my field. It's not really a problem. No terrorist will care about high-nitrogen compounds like the stuff out of Klapötke's group. Way too hard to make, while you can easily make simple explosives out of common items.	None	0

Regardless though, you're right, the gentle approach is best and the Socratic method is best for getting people to spell out and then realise their own moral inconsistencies.	When I come up across this in GENUINE conversation, I like to ask them to explain what they think is so extreme.  I then, politely, re-iterate my feelings that I as a person do not need animal products to survive, that animals do suffer to produce this food, that climate science is demanding a switch.   We usually at least agree that buying a different type of hot dog doesn't amount to extremism in the end.	None	None	0

gj0en0j	Motorsport UK explains post-Brexit process for European transport	Thanks for the insight, pretty interesting.	They have bloc touring rigs that they prep for certain areas. So the americas would get one set of equipment and packed off to tour *that* trade area. Whilst the far east get another etc etc. That rig then comes home to be prepped again. That way you skip the issues trying to get rigs into different trading areas. The big outfits have local contacts and providers as well. It aint cheap and a massive logistical headache.	Presumably this is the same set of requirements as when they race in other parts of the world?	International tours of bands use the same technique. Often laying over rigs in their respective areas whilst the band pick up dates in other areas before resuming the 'tour' in that previous customs area.   Maiden perfected this art. Especially with Bruce being able to fly the band everywhere. Set up a show in Vancouver. Play the show. Fly to Berlin on the Euro leg. Fly back to Seattle to pick up the American tour after the set has been struck and transported . . .   ad nauseam. Which some of the crew reported to being in bad turbulence. Its a cost benefit thing with multiple sets costing so much but not moving far when they are on that tour leg, against the cost of moving one set all around the world. Sometimes back and forth thousands of miles depending on dates.   Touring is a lifestyle, its not a life.	0

I like and respect both of them, but both of them frustrated me to no end on this one. Sam was stupid to have touched the third rail to begin with. Ezra was doing Ezra things, contextualizing, examining presuppositions and making sure that biases were being accounted for. But ultimately Sam was looking  for capitulation and exculpation after getting hit by that sloppy Vox article which Ezra did not write, but that Sam held him responsible for. Ezra was not willing to throw his writers under the bus, and concocted smokescreen after smokescreen. And in the end we learn nothing and everyone hates each other just a little more.	None	Agreed.

Self managed, de facto completely voluntary, "you can still go out food shopping and other essential activities",  welcome to use public transport from the airport.  Absolute joke.	There was a time between then and now where there were no travel corridors and everyone had to quarantine.	Only a year late.	Yet it’s the people who don’t wear masks who cause the problem according to the media?  Maybe the government should have made sure millions and millions of people who had to work to pay their bills were covered, thus actually ensuring a proper lockdown on the ground too.

gjehsgs	My aunt had a still birth, thank fuck!	I'm going to walk you through this slowly:  1) In this subreddit, birth is considered bad.  2) Not meanie bad. More like REALLY bad. We're talking at the level of murder and rape.  3) Therefore, when birth is prevented, it's like someone was rescued from a murderer or rapist.  4) No one extends condolences to a murderer or rapist who failed to follow through. Therefore, don't expect those who see birth as this REALLY bad thing to extend any sympathy to an individual who would have perpetuated that REALLY bad act.  You may not agree with this, and for that there is the back button.	Bro shes probably so upset wtf	None	But from my understanding, we’re here and childless because we see life as inescapable anguish. And we care so much about people not going through the suffering in life, hence being against it all. If that’s where you’re at, then I’m with you, I agree.   But if you can’t look at the anguish of those already in life and feel sympathy for their anguish, regardless of how YOU feel about the situation and whether you would feel the same pain, then you’re still the problem here. We have to care about each other while we’re here, not regress and enjoy the pain of your aunt. You can have bittersweet feelings, hate that there was ever going to be a niece or nephew coming into inevitable climate change or whatever it is you fear in our impending fate. But not consoling your aunt as she suffers through this regardless if you thinks she’s wrong or brainwashed is just as problematic.   And- to argue that having a child is just as bad as murder is dissonant within this logos. Murder would be a good thing right? Because that’s another life that doesn’t have to suffer? You can’t argue it’s as bad, because that isn’t the subjective feeling of most people anyway, in any culture. Including this particular internet subculture.   Tl;dr you can be compassionate to the loss and pain of those around you while still being philosophically opposed to natalism	0
gjgjsus	If you struggle with money, but smoke a pack of cigarette every day, I don't feel bad for you at all.	&gt; smoking is disgusting  Agreed. Doesn’t make it ethical to milk money off people who are addicted to smoking  &gt; you’re harming other people  1. Why are you using the present tense? I’ve been off nicotine for years 2. I never actually smoked a cigarette. I vaped, but only around other people who vaped as well 3. Now let’s look at the people who do currently smoke cigs. Many just smoke outside or around other smokers. Only a subset will do things like smoke in the house around their kids or something. Even for this subset though, how is it ethical to milk money off them? Simply ends up making life even harder for those kids  &gt; You can’t blame the government  You can absolutely blame the government for milking money off cigarette addicts. Honestly, they’re nearly as bad as the damn tobacco companies. Again, many places have a tax of **100% (or more)** on cigarettes. Buy a pack of cigs, and the government profits more than the tobacco company  &gt; consider the tax a payment toward your healthcare when you eventually develop a chronic illness  I live in the US; that’s not how healthcare works here  But let’s say that a smoker lives in a place with universal healthcare. That smoker is **already** paying taxes on their income   And look, governments around the world are *incredibly* deceitful about this. They try to act like obscene cigarette taxes are there to curb smoking. But again, thanks to the inelasticity of nicotine, these high taxes have a comparatively low effect on smoking rates. The clear motive is to milk money off addicts	No, smoking is disgusting. You're harming other people. You can't blame the government, hell, consider the tax a payment toward your healthcare when you eventually develop a chronic illness.	I’d agree with this **if cigarette taxes weren’t so obscene**. In many places, there is a 100%+ tax on cigarettes. That’s ridiculous. The supposed motive behind this is to curb smoking. But nicotine is an *incredibly* inelastic commodity. In other words, an increase in price leads to a significantly smaller decrease in demand.   Anyone who’s been a nicotine addict can confirm. Back when I was an addict, juul pods were $15 a pack. But i would’ve paid $30 without hesitation if it ever came to that  Thanks to this inelasticity, taxes are a horrible way to curb smoking. As such, the government is basically just milking money off addicts. Honestly disgusting. And that’s why I feel bad for smokers who are strapped for cash. They probably wouldn’t be if the government stopped siphoning money off them	Goddamn, the excuses...smoking outside doesn't magically make the smoke disappear, people still breath that shit in. Sidewalks, bus stops, outside of buildings, parks, etc.        You keep acting like the government is the bad guy here. Smokers should quit, and then they won't be affected by whatever it is you're complaining about. No one is forcing them to smoke, and you're acting like everything is forcing them to smoke.	0
gjh42tq	I think our brains are guided by previous versions of ourselves from parallel universes.	Singular parallel universe or multiple parallel universe**s**? In your post, you claimed that it was multiple	I'm thinking you get matched with parallel universes that are the same age as you.   But I wouldn't be so quick to judge the intelligence of children. They might not have the same control of their bodies, or language. But the thoughts of children are very clever.	If this were the case, then adults and children would have similar maturities. Think about it. According to you, we’ve all lived countless lives before. So living one more life wouldn’t increase your maturity/life experience all that much  Of course, this is not the case. An average 60 year old is significantly more mature than an average 6 year old. Because that 60 year old has significantly more life experience.	Well, I think it's one parallel universe at a time speaking to you, but they come from an infinite amount of parallel universes. So the thoughts are rotating between different yous.	0
gjhbcsf	Transhumanism Antecedents	Not necessarily. A good chunk of early humanism involved taking a closer look at what early Christian theologians had written, and the first several centuries of that world were a *lot* more diverse and vibrant intellectually than a lot of people these days are aware of (or want to be aware of). That doesn't necessarily support or taint subsequent philosophies, but it's not surprising that it was there in the first place.	A good point, and well taken. I think its very telling that the philosophy surrounding transhumanism (insofar as there is a distinct philosophy) emerged in  Christian circles. It seems at odds with what one might expect, yes?	I view them as sort of like Galileo. The first step on a better path, but still so fundamentally flawed that its not really worth considering them deeply. If you want to get to the moon you need Newton at the least. We should  be grateful to those who came before, but we should be wary of creating traditions, as they tend to have a life of their own.

Furthermore  dont ignore its disastrous effects of the market.   When you have industrial cartels in the market like a single payer system would, you kill competition and leave this state monopoly as the only choice. Throw in condition of need laws and other regulation and industrial cartels can seize control of markets very easily. Allowing them to cut supply and raise rates, like theyve been doing since Medicare and Medicaid subsidies.   If you want more supply and less cost you go for a free market capitalist system where competition keeps prices low and supply high.	healthcare pls	Yea you can trust liblefts to understand central banking.	0

If you or I were suddenly asked to take a 50% pay cut for doing the same job, where other companies are still paying full wage, we'd leave for another company right? It's exactly the same. Why should somebody work for less than what they're worth?	That is such bull shit.  People truly are the most evil, greedy, terrible creatures in existence.

I haven't messed around with trying to split it inzo a seprate file, so if you need to do that, I'f have to learn with xou to help you at.	"--write-metadata" is just enough? I get empty txt files and json files with the link and resolution of the image but no descriptions.	If you're still having trouble, I know the right settings to use for gallery-dl.  Just make sure the metadata setting is set to true, and run the command with the --write-metadata option. It will generate metadata files that have the descriptions among other things, and save them alongside the downloaded files.	Thanks! Where is that conf file located?	0
f9n4nco	Thanksgiving and Christmas seem more obscene to me than ever	That was said by Juliet Schor in the documentary 'Minimalism'. It has stuck with me aswell :)	I wish I could remember who said this in an interview but she was asked if she thought we were too materialistic as a society and her answer was absolutely not. She went on to explain how we are not materialistic in terms of actual materials. We care far more about cost, novelty and brand/packaging as indicators of quality.  Really made me rethink the way I give and receive gifts. In my family now we dont even have a dollar limit on gifts anymore. My infant niece who is also my God daughter is getting a bowl mug and plate set that belonged to her mother (my sister) that I found when clearing out my parents garage.  We tried to do a no gift Christmas one year, and I really think we missed the giving more than the receiving. Im hoping that eventually well be able to celebrate without me dragging a bag of cardboard and plastic to the curb on the 26th, but in the mean time getting together with family is really the reason for the season.

f9qmtu4	If a person wants to eat a diet with the greatest possible limitations, how limited can a human diet be before sacrificing health, assuming he/she takes no vitamin supplements?	I would try to stick to the daily dozen, that includes beans, berries, fruits, cruciferous, leafy green and starchy vegetables, seeds, nuts, whole grains and spices.  So for example chickpeas, blueberries, apples, broccoli, spinach, sweet potato, flax seeds, peanuts, quinoa and turmeric. I chose these specific ones because they are quite versatile.   I am not a dietician however, and there might be better options. The most important thing when it comes to diet however is variety, as far as I know, especially if you do not want to take supplements. So I would not recommend eating the exact same things every day, but at least switch it up as the seasons change. You could use local, seasonal vegetables for example.	If you had to subsist on the smallest possible number of different foods (condiments and spices included), without vitamin supplements and without sacrificing health as compared to a standard modern diet, what would that number be?	I live with a pretty limited diet, according to most people. I eat only plant based whole foods, so no animal products, no processed foods, no simple carbs, no sugar, no artificial sweeteners, no alcohol. I also fast every day for at least 16 hours. I do take B12 though, as pretty much everyone should.  On the other hand, I eat a large variety of different fruits and vegetables every day, whole grains, legumes etc. So it's not really that limited in the true sense, I suppose.   What limitations were you thinking about? Cutting out specific foods or more like eating the same thing every day?	None	0

fdd385u	How to approach sex with my (16M) boyfriend (15FtM)	Yes he’s on birth control because getting periods made his dysphoria get RREEALLYY fucked up.

It seems like you already have some ideas of his limits, which is great! But tbh he might not know all of his limits yet.   Also, another thing worth noting, always use birth control if your gentials get even near his. Even if he's on T, there is still pregnancy risk.	None	Ah well that'll be handy for this too!   Like i said, then, just take it slow and make sure he's comfortable. You don't need to treat him like he's super fragile, but make sure he's got opportunities to tell you if he doesn't like something.   Good luck!	0

fgs35wq	Conways Game Of Life	If our universe was created by a God in some sort of "higher existence" then for all intents and purposes it is the same as a simulation.  I.e. the _creation_ account of our universe necessarily implies another universe, which begs for explanation on its own.  This is the beginning of the infinite regress argument; that for ultimate creation to originate with God you need an infinite sequence of God's (or simulations) to contain them.  You can only get out of this loop if you	It assures that complexity doesnt require intelligence, correct? When talking about the origin of a universe, time is arbitrary, so those initial conditions have an eternity to be met. I understand this is delving into pre Big-Bang territory, which is all speculation, but say the universe emerged from something which has the ability to produce or alter specific properties, which give birth to different Universes. What is your guess for our Universes origin? (God, Simulation, Natural selection, etc)	Any claim that Conway’s game of life tells you about reality is just metaphor. At best, it’s a proof of concept: given simple rules of “physics” and certain initial conditions, complex things can happen. It’s mostly just fun to mess around with.	None	0

fkd8bzz	We are the most unlucky people on the planet	Sometimes I feel as though MDD has rewritten my operating code, no matter what intervention it's set in stone.	The hardest part is that if you havent had anhedonia yourself then you cant understand it. Normal people cant comprehend what its like to live without emotion or pleasure. Its like trying to describe color to someone who has been blind their whole life. It just doesnt make sense to them. People think clinical depression is just sadness but anhedonia is so much worse.   I dont blame them for their ignorance. Had I not been through this myself I never could have believed this state existed. One solace I take is that there is this community online of people going through the same thing. For so long I felt I was the only person on earth that had this. I feel at least some ease knowing I am not going through this alone, and that other have found varying levels of success treating these symptoms.	Not to throw a pity party, but at least it's easier for other people to change. Emotion is like a GPS. We're lost without it.	It just takes a while to reroute your neural pathways away from that.

fvm0cjk	Is there a term for this?	Way I see it, there are these two layers in each and every argument - the rational exchange and testing of ideas bit, and the interpersonal, primate hierarchy stuff. This is human, and it's OK, if managed.  We have culturally evolved the former to mitigate and manage the latter, to make larger and larger collaborations possible (democracy = good). So the rules of healthy democratic debate suggest assuming good faith, seeking mutual understanding and empathy, removing emotion, restraining the impulse to insult, ridicule or physically crush the other party.  The best political voices channel that primate impulse into thorough and searching exploration of their own *and their opponents*' partisan views, their basis, their implications, so they are rarely frustrated in dialogue - they profoundly understand what they're up against and they know where the holes are in that wall.	I think thats exactly what I was looking for! The reason I was initially searching for this term was due to what the reps and dems are doing for covid and how I believe that its turning into more of a battle for the presidency. Pushing agendas that wont be passed because the propositions are too loaded to be accepted by the counter party. Instead of working together for the greater good, theyre just trying to win the popular vote of their party to ensure more voters go to the polls. Meanwhile, in reality, the promises and advantages wont ever see the light of day.   This explanation on the Wikipedia page cited Daniel Bell & Darko Suvin to explain: It came to be used as a formula describing the inevitability of class struggle, i.e. who (which of two antagonists) will dominate the other. **In this view, all compromises and promises between enemies are just expedientstactical manoeuvres in the struggle for mastery.**	In *Superforecasting,* Philip Tetlock calls something similar to what you describe "kto-kogo" ("Who, whom?"), after Lenin's slogan.   >Arguments and evidence are lovely adornments but what matters is the ceaseless contest to be the *kto,* not the *kogo.* It follows that the goal of forecasting is *not* to see what's coming. It is to advance the interests of the forecaster and the forecaster's tribe. Accurate forecasts may help do that sometimes, and when they do accuracy is welcome, but it is pushed aside if that's what the pursuit of power requires. (p. 254)     It doesn't look like this has been widely (or even narrowly) adopted though.	None	0

This a terrible thing to say, and just goes to show how little destiny knew about drugs (and probably you, if you actually think this a defensible argument). This is not something ANYONE wants, and you're a moron if you think anyone would actually want to go through this again. Destiny has said and recognized that this experience brought him actual real mental harm, like the panic attacks. This doesnt mean that he didnt benefit from it, he did. But even he said that hes never ever gonna do a dose like that again, and he learned a hard hitting lesson.  2. This is extremely true, and the third person should have been acting as the tripsitter. But i dont think the person had any experience with drugs at all, and its not okay to place that burden on anyone who has no idea how to handle these situations.   They both should have taken it more seriously. Thats it.	0

fyi7ews	Are animals that are wild and die naturally vegan?	The only issue I can see with it is that it could be construed as 'disrespectful' to the animal, similarly to how it would be frowned upon to eat a dead person who did not consent to being eaten. Personally, however, I don't see any issue ethically as there is no suffering imposed on the animal. In fact, as you pointed out, it's better for the environment than buying a meal at a shop.	That is why I asked. Because that would not be exploitative or cruel. If it if free and dies then it will never be exploited.   It will just rot. But no one is cruel to it. But it could save animals that die during harvesting	“Veganism is a way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose.”	The thing is that it will be eaten anyway. By something. We care if humans eat us but humans are eaten in the ground.  This could potentially save other animals.	0

g5qgwyl	Question about vocal processing	in the case of agonal lust they have a very minimal set up (im assuming you were at their only live show in chicago?) while koufar is much more focused on modular synths. i prefer the former to the latter but to each their own.   i would also look into how you record yr vocals. this can add a lot without the need for effects. concrete methods are always going to sound more obscure imho. for example i record on an old tape deck that as a shit dot mic on it. crunches up everything quite nicely without the need for an effect pedal. i have seen people use old karaoke machines to great effect in this way.   i highly encourage you to think outside of the box of "gear" as it will open up new worlds to you.	Word, thank you! Ive been eyeing his stuff for a while. I find myself hiding behind effects pedals when it comes to live performances because I still really am trying to learn to have the stage presence of someone like Agonal Lust or Koufar	buy a microphone from crank sturgeon. no effects needed they already sound dirty af. most of his shit is under $30 & built to last.

I think it behooves us to think about renovating the decred homepage to reflect this new era in DCR. Assuming there isn’t already a plan in place to change up the landing page. 1.6 will bring new and old eyes to the website and we should take advantage of that renewed interest because if we don’t, that’s a major missed opportunity in my humble opinion.

gahcpoq	I have heard that a disease like measles can wipe out a persons immune “history” and knowledge. How does this affect autoimmune conditions like allergies, Crohns etc?	Maybe, but it would probably be easier to remove the lymphoid stem cells from the bone marrow. We can already do that with bone marrow transplants.  There are [case reports](https://acaai.org/news/great-disappearing-act-bone-marrow-receiver-cured-allergy) of people being cured of allergies after a bone marrow transplant. There are also [case reports](https://www.nature.com/articles/bmt2010150) of the opposite - people receiving allergies after a bone marrow transplant.	Would it be possible, by pure chance (or perhaps futuristic guidance), to remove all memory cells that are auto immune, thus giving the body a time without them?  Then, if the creation of the auto-immunity was just a fluke of a failure, perhaps the next time it comes up, it can be filtered by normal biological processes?  Is this something that could, in theory, be used in the future to treat auto-immune diseases?	The measles virus can infect memory T-cell and B-cells in the lymph nodes, which erases the "memories" of previous infections. This is called immune amnesia.  However, the lymphoid stem cells are still present in the bone marrow, and they continually produce new T-cells and B-cells. Everybody has T-cells and B-cells that want to attack their own tissues, as well as allergens (like peanuts).  Usually, these T-cells and B-cells are suppressed through a number of mechanisms: thymus selection, clonal deletion, immune checkpoints, Bregs and Tregs. When these mechanisms fail, you get autoimmune disorders. Measles does not correct these mechanisms, so it doesn't cure autoimmune disorders.	But a transplant like this would not purge the already existing memory cells, as far as I understand it.  I don't recall the life expectancy of memory cells, is it short enough that they'll purge on their own after such a transplant? If not, would we not need some form of controlled purging of memory cells to remove the symptoms, after removing the cause?	0

I honestly don't know! I just know I want out of TN.   I know i want snow again! I do definitely lean more towards rural but not awfully far away from a city.  Like 30-35 minutes is a decent distance. Im also not opposed to being close to somewhere with decent night life, and people around my age (22)    I'm also interested in somewhere with solid school districts to work in. I havent done much research in that department, besides looking into the ones in Maine.	What are you looking for? The Northan NE states (ME, NH, VT) are more rural than the southern ones (MA, CT, RI), but aren't rural how you are used to in Ohio unless you're all the way up by the border.	Bachelors,  but I will be getting my masters. I have looked into it a little.  So far it looks like most require a Bachelors degree and time in a teacher prep program + their particular states praxis tests or additional ones and some require at least 30 months of full time teaching experience, etc etc etc. I think once I which states I'm interested in the most I'll start emailing the Education departments there and asking!

gbvt6w6	Toucan goes clickety clack	This toucan is a rescue bird that cannot be rewilded. Follow the link in the video (lower right hand corner).	Ahh, toucans should not be in a house, ever.  Edit:  I'm not saying rehab for disabled animals is wrong.  I'm saying they should not be in a house.  2CAN TV has done fundraisers and I'm thrilled they have, but I disagree with the channel's highlight on the pet aspect of their toucans because I think it contributes negatively to the problems that made the birds require rehab in the first place.  Edit 2:  I guess one more point I can make is just because the animal needs lifelong care does not mean it's suddenly a pet.  I don't know since when rehab meant it's suddenly okay if they treat it like a pet.	None	Oh yeah, i forgot the part about animal rehabbing that means they're suddenly just fine to keep as pets.  2CAN TV is self serving and does not fully educate about the core problem that led the bird to need rehab in the first place, nor do I feel they approach rehab correctly.  I'm familiar with the source of the video.  Even if they are birds that need rescuing, their claim of being educational is stretched very thin over their years of content and they mostly post pictures and videos with a million hashtags and links to their merch store.  More birds will need "rehabbing" when the core problem of habitat destruction and wild captures for pet trade is what cause this bird to be disabled in the first place. Few of their videos or posts are about that.  I don't claim to be an expert or know the person personally; I'm sure they do care about toucans and taking in so many is an incredible amount of work and I'm sure it means everything to the birds who had to be taken in.  I just do not believe it's truly as education or helpful as they claim, based on the titles of their videos and lack of thoughtful disclaimers about how these animals are not pets.  Because they treat them as pets, flat out.	0

Also the physical appearance uses a mix of male and female (female chest and smooth leg on the left side, male chest and muscly leg on the right side). Given they don't have a clearly-defined gender and their physical appearance uses a mix of male and female, the gender-neutral pronoun "they" would probably be the best choice here.	None	You go kid.

I will try to mix it up to make sure i'm where I need to be with nutrition. I drink a lot of soy milk and have a B12 supplement I take sometimes because I read thats the only one you really need. Is there a good source of vitamin D in food or is a supplement good for that? Trying not to go overboard on the supplements haha	Hi. I’ll try to offer advice.   Not able to work out like you used to? Is that a time constraint thing, or just not having the juice during workouts like you used to?   You say you’re not getting enough protein; how do you know this? Have you tracked your intake over a day? There’s plenty of protein in your diet from what I see.   Instant pot is my favorite kitchen investment.

gf9whva	Phenibut alternatives?	Others might differ but I found gabapentin not like phenibut at all	With that stack, you will most likely be stimulated, although I highly doubt it will be similar to phenibut.  I'm not sure what country you're in, but you could look into gabapentin. It is a pharmaceutical, similar to phenibut. Here in the US you can get it prescribed or you can buy it online. Not sure about the legality in your area, you'll have to check.  If you do use gabapentin, keep in mind that you still should not take it every day.  I can't think of any supplements or anything else that would be similar to phenibut.	None	None	0

gfk6cb5	How do all manage to read so much and so effectively?	I think it could be preferable to find a group where there is some common ground, e.g. a local group in your town/city, from your college's alma mater, friends of friends. Compared to internet strangers, it makes things a bit less icy, and easier to get things flowing. Maybe hunt around on Facebook pages and groups?   If you have trouble finding a reading group, you can also join online seminars and talks that are offered by institutions and universities for free, by the way. I've noticed many of these popping up nowadays, because of the coronavirus. I often see these on Facebook events (it helps following pages/groups that post about these events), and the algorithm probably recommends similar future events. Such talks usually involve reading a text beforehand, then watching a Zoom lecture or presentation by a speaker on the text. Earlier this year I attended some of these live webinars http://www.londonsociety-nls.org.uk/index.php?file=Programme/webinar-on-seminar-xvii.html that were cool, and from there it even splintered into small reading/research groups of 4-5 people, connected to each other by e-mail.   To find FB pages to follow for crit theory stuff and event postings (and there are many subfields), you can use the search function for various authors (Deleuze, Bataille, Bourdieu etc) or topics (postcolonialism, logic, ecocriticism) and look for quality pages or groups to join.	How do you find that sort of thing? As just a lay person I'd be worried the level of knowledge in the group would be way over my head as well.	It's a nice motivator to be in a small online (Zoom, Skype etc. for that ftf connection) or in-person reading group, you get to read broadly and as deeply as you can manage. If there's one or two people in that group quite knowledeable about certain areas, they can teach you a lot as well.	None	0

Sekiro will be the most familiar to you from fallen order, as they both rely on a single weapon (lightsaber/katana) with a focus on parry timing.

gg07sjh	[R] Why do knowledge distillation papers always use KL-divergence as constraints?	^ this ^	I think it is a bit of a stretch to say that Cross-entropy isn't mathematically justified.  Cross-entropy is essentially the log-likelihood of the categorical distribution (aka 1 draw from the multinomial distribution).  So when you are optimizing for cross-entropy -- you are essentially looking for the MAP / MLE solution.   Is this typically a good idea?  Well, if your loss-landscape is super bumpy, you may get caught in local optima.  Plus MAP / MLE are point estimations -- you can't get uncertainty quantification for either of those.  KL-divergence and other probabilistic metrics can help quantify the difference between the true and estimated posterior distributions.  So when you are trying to estimate the model parameters, you don't get a single estimate, but the \*distribution\* of possible model parameters (which you can think of as an ensemble of models).	When comparing two distributions, the cross entropy is a hack both out of numerical techniques. There’s two things here, one is *mathematically* correct, the other is practical implementation for computation.  Cross entropy is easily differentiable, has some nice properties, and computationally efficient. However that does not mean it’s a mathematically justified concept, just that it meets the bar of “good enough” in several categories for implementation as a loss function.  KL divergence is a mathematically justified approach to comparing two distributions. There’s several derivations online. The one I remember being quite nice is in the PGM book by Koller which demonstrates the original derivation and connects it to both calculus of variations and variational inference.  Other methods are also well justified mathematically. E.g., Jensen divergence, Wasserstein distance.	None	0

Why not just look into the subject when met with new concepts instead of responding with anger?	Lmao I was building a rant in my head until I decided to see what the dog looked like	Dogs shouldn't be veg- oh... Carry on vegan buddy	It’s not anger it’s more frustration cos there’s people who do just make their animals go vegan.

Why, Bethesda, did you make building so much worse when it was already buggy and limited? :(	Damn.  Really calling me out there with number 2.	I don't know where those fancy builds are because 99% of camps I visit are either:  1.Most basic wooden shack with crafting stations.  2.A huge two floor house that has every single thing that the person unlocked placed against the wall leaving a huge empty space in the middle.

I believe it's because they want you to use the prefab building they're happy to sell you.  Most likely easier to render and, of course, they make money from them.

And considering you're near the NOLA area (a place that has a TON of mystical energies floating around, including various gods, loa, orishas, etc...) it might be a good idea to ask the spirit of the land before using it's bounties in a working (just to be sure you don't mistakenly offend it and cause crossed conditions to crop up.)  If the mud is the right consistency, you could turn it into clay for a poppet or other artistic means by letting it dry out just enough (but this assumes you have clay mud.)  EDIT: make sure you give something back in exchange for the gifts of the water and mud.

I'd do it 'cause I have at least 7 of those dragon trees and I'm working on getting the lvl 10 tribal dragon.   Things to know: 1. the dragon tree wonder is disappointing (takes up lots of space and rewards aren't that great). 2. the tribal dragon is slow with poor stamina 3. That lvl dragon tree is probably the best for getting ruby fire mystery eggs. 4.

It’s like a big red rash (particularly on the torso) with little white bumps all over that are violently itchy. It’s a major reason why I hate summer so much (family history of skin cancer doesn’t help, either).	Do you have seasonal affective disorder? Basically seasonal depression but it does tend to trigger in people who dont get enough sunlight. My sister has it and lived in the UK for two years.   As for me I have lower energy and motivation on overcast days. I overheat pretty easily and the sun provokes my eczema, so I prefer rainy weather. I also cant breathe when it gets too hot. I have a chronic illness with body temperature regulation issues which then gives me blood oxygen circulation issues, so struggling to breathe is something I have had to deal with at times, even pre-COVID. My testosterone levels tend to make me overheat too. When it was too high I used to get heat hives which is like a burning electricity coursing throughout your body. It also makes it hard to sweat. I know that sounds like Prince Andrew but thats what happened. I sweat buckets now.  So yeah, I prefer the cold.	None	I didn’t really get bumps. I got a raising of the skin and a reddish rash.

Extra info - my mum currently owns horses and when she was younger she used to be quite allergic to them, but it went away as she got older could this be a reaction to that?	None	She suffers from fibromyalgia and arthritis. And she recently recovered from covid but shes not completely over the effects. There is a history of heart failure in both my uncles and my grandad and grandmother. We haven't been traveling anywhere because of covid and there's been no trauma to her fingers	0
ghif7dq	The Life in The Simpsons Is No Longer Attainable - The most famous dysfunctional family of 1990s television enjoyed, by today’s standards, an almost dreamily secure existence.	Yeah, I get the article's point and it's not wrong that things have gotten harder, but using the Simpsons as some sort of proof of larger economic trends makes no sense to me. It's a TV show and the decision not to focus on economic problems in later seasons was a writing choice. This is like using Friends as evidence for how rich young people were in the 90s. Yeah, the job market for young people might have been better off then, but even in the 90s, Friends was  clearly unrealistic in terms of the kind of apartment struggling young people could afford in NYC.   All TV shows are just kind of like that unless being poor and struggling is one of the main aspects of the show is about the main characters struggling economically. Look at a more recent show like Family Guy -- it's also a one-working-parent household with three kids and a dog and Peter's job (some clerk at a brewing company?) is even worse than Homer's, but they still have a decent house and rarely seem to struggle (unless an episode calls for it).	Originally, the Simpsons was largely about how they didn't have much but they had each other. The early seasons really showed them struggle monetarily.  That's a harsh contrast against the statement "an almost dreamily secure existence"	None	But even if these shows are based on tropes that are only loosely based on reality, they were still a strong part of the public consciousness and narrative of what made up american working class life at the time.  For example the tons of pre 2000s cubicle themed movies focusing on white men in or entering their 30s with extremely stable but boring office jobs that make money but don't fulfill their dreams. Those types of extremely prevalent narratives are now all but a relic from the past.	0

He's referring to the notion that, in general, as women get older they select for men less on the basis of how good-looking they are.	I dated into my 30s before I met my husband.  Not sure what you mean by standards (like, why wouldnt kindness and career stability be standards?), so not sure how to answer this.	None	Exactly as u/Cedow said.  But, assuming you are correct, I don’t consider myself as having dropped my standards.  And I’ve never thought of them as “my standards.”  I find my husband incredibly attractive, though he’s not the mythical Chad.  But he is what “my standards” always wanted: perfect for me.	0

He did good at msu too although he did have a bit of shuffling and limited time.  Not saying it is great but he is installing a new offense and having to teach qb's who were previously taught by Arroyo so I'm sure he has a lot of work you know without spring an all.	0

I can only imagine how intimidating and frustrating seeing that symbol must be to our black Ashevillians. I'm sure it would affect whether a person of color is able to trust the officer that steps out of the car. I'd like to report it and have the car number, but am not sure where.

What part usually gives out first? i have a pair of Salomons and only stopped wearing them because of how shredded the sides got. They didn't blow out but since there doesn't seem to be any wrap around of the sole, the trail just tore them up.	Frankly, there are a lot of things I'd go cheap on, but foot care ain't one of em.   That said, I met people that had Reebok's to sandals to whatever. I think so long as it's comfy in daily life (and dries quickly), it should be fine. The real question, I think, is whether you'd rather buy new fancy shoes every 500miles or cheaper shoes more often.	None	0

Jesus Christ you people are stupid.  This isn’t a fucking Target or an Auto zone. This is the capital of the United States. If you claim a country’s capital city then you have won whatever war you were fighting and conquered the country. This was the direct attempt to conquer the country. This invasion of DC is clearly the higher national security priority. A retail store is not a national security concern.  A true right winger actually cares about due process and achieving the ends through ethical means. Which is more or less the core concept of being a right winger.

gih8o2q	Upset my “malshi” is more of a mutt. So sad.

You may know “more about dog breeds than most” but you have a lot to learn in terms of genetics, and most importantly, ethical breeding practice.	Well, yeah, but a mutt I chose the breeds for. I work in veterinary medicine. I know more about dog breeds than most.	Even if she was 50% Shih Tzu and 50% Maltese, your dog would still be a mutt.  Designer breeds are not real breeds, they are just expensive mutts.  That said, I am a big fan of mutts.	He was supposed to be an f1b, meaning one purebred parent and 1 malshi. At least 50% should have been shih tzu. It should have been between 60-80% shih tzu due to the f1b.  Edit: I also spent 2 years in genetic coding in college. I know about hereditary genetics. You assumed he was an F1, which I never said he was. I said he had a purebred parent (supposedly). Don’t jump to conclusions.	0

ginmsb7	Switched to buying stocks and shares instead of makeup	Derivatives are too complicated to explain well in a Reddit comment, but the basic idea is that they are securities whose value is based on the value of other underlying securities.   The simplest example of how you could lose more money than you put in is a basic option trade. Say that you think the value of XYZ stock is going to fall next week. So you come to me and ask to borrow one share of XYZ, which you’ll return next Tuesday and pay a small fee. I loan it to you, you sell it today for $10. When next Tuesday rolls around, if you’re right and the price of the share is now $5, you go out to the market and buy a new share, give it to me, and you pocket the $5 difference (minus the small fee for the borrowing). But if you’re wrong, and next Tuesday the price of the share is $20, you still have to go out and buy one, and then give me that share plus the fee. You’d be out $10 more than the value of the original investment. And the stock price could soar to $50, in which case you’d be out $40 more, etc.   For a really sad story of how this can play out with unsophisticated investors playing with derivatives trading, you can see [this story](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2020/06/17/20-year-old-robinhood-customer-dies-by-suicide-after-seeing-a-730000-negative-balance/amp/) (trigger warning: suicide).	How is it possible to lose more money than invested? What are derivatives in plain simple English?	I love this and before I took my current job, I loved playing around on robinhood. (Now I have too much access to non-public info and cannot trade.) BUT for both OP and anyone else reading this- please, please don’t do this with money that would be painful to lose. It’s a fine hobby, you may make some money. But all of the data indicates that individual stock picking is a losing strategy compared to investing in a low cost index or mutual fund. And it comes with real risks. Tons of hobbyist investors got burned with Hertz stock this summer, and especially as it’s become possible for hobbyists to trade derivatives, you can lose A LOT of money (even more than you originally invested).   As a hobby, with money that wouldn’t hurt to lose, and so long as you’re sticking to actual stocks (no derivatives), I love this. But please don’t do it with, for example, your retirement savings.	Thanks for explanation. It is really terrible incident and that they had gamify the investing. Those who are addicted to games would lose big money easily.	0

giu6wod	Just adopted this 8 month old GSD. All black with a very small white patch. He's a very good boy, but still very much a puppy. Long road ahead of us but it's a dream come true!	Eight months old is a hellage. That is the age when most dogs get rehomed due to "allergy in the family".   So when you feel drained, take courage. He will never be worse than he is right now, it will only get better.  Time is the most underrated dog training tool.	Yes we're planning on 3 walks a day plus I play disc golf and we love hiking! We're reading tons about training and are already working on his habits (he's decently trained but not where he needs to be). Our biggest focus right now is introducing him to the cats (he was raised with a cat so we know he can be nice but the cats will need time) and avoiding distractions. He gets a little excited by other dogs and he has a booming bark, so we want to help him focus on his task at hand whether it be walking, sitting, etc. I know it's going to take time but we are so excited to shape him into our perfect companion	Congratulations! He’s a very handsome boy. Be sure to do tons of training and give him lots of exercise. Very active breed!	Well he's pretty good now so that's great to hear! He lived with two young children growing up and met my best friend's toddler today. She was in her stroller and we let him slowly approach her. He just sat down and licked her hands. So we're very optimistic for his human interactions! But we will keep working on his focus and dog interactions. Thanks for the encouragement!	0

giwc1so	Do you think Scrum Masters add value?	We got very close to this in my old job that I sometimes miss a lot. Somehow the stars aligned and we seemed to have a team that worked in absolute flow, even when people had personal issues come up, everyone looked out for one another. God knows if ill find that again.	From my experience, a good scrum master can make a big difference. A good scrum master will always be looking for ways to improve the way the team works daily and discuss routes that the team can take to ensure they meet the sprint goal on time with as few blockers as possible (e.g by catching them ahead of time).   When I switched to a team with a scrum master who didnt really care, there was a bit more of a chaotic approach to things, dealing with blockers and getting used to how things are working day to day, that we forget to improve ourselves constantly, even though we had retrospectives, they were just not as efficient.  Now there is a possibility where the whole team takes over the scrum master role, looking out for things the individual would do. I have yet to experience this but I cant say its impossible.

Not sure if they are removeable on the one you linked but it's at least a possibility.	Do you mean that you don't use the bar anymore since you have the rings?  I was thinking of something like this: https://www.yakosport.eu/ceiling-mounted-pull-up-bar-insportline-rk110.html  Is this what you mean?	I bought a doorway pull up bar and later rings to hang from it. Now I've realised could've just done only rings from the start, I hang them below a set of stairs.   One tip I have if you do get a pull up bar is avoid ones with the neutral grip holds that stick out and can't be removed.

gj1cgmi	Coronavirus shutdowns have quashed nearly all other common viruses. But scientists say a rebound is coming.	These doomers are woefully ignorant about the flu.  * The average efficacy of the flu vaccine is 40%. * Certain strains, like influenza B, are more dangerous for kids.  * The flu can cause permanent damage, especially lung damage.  * Current antiviral medications for the flu are either ineffective or have very small benefit, especially for the healthy. These drugs are currently used as a "last resort" or for otherwise very sick patients. * Some of the most lethal pandemics in history were caused by the flu. (So much for "we have an immunity!")	Some of these viruses are particularly nasty for kids.  RSV kills a number of small children every year, and a surge in that would be particularly tragic.  Also what do they think will happen when flu comes back?  Into a population that hasn't been exposed to it in a few years?  Flu undergoes genetic drift and the further away the virus is from your existing immunity the more likely you'll get sick.

gj1e8l9	Coronavirus shutdowns have quashed nearly all other common viruses. But scientists say a rebound is coming.	Complete B.S.  COVID-19 and the influenza are approximately the same size (60-100 *μm* ), with some studies pointing out the influenza can be even smaller than COVID-19.  If masks and social-distancing have been so effective with the flu (by virtually eliminating it), then why hasn't it done a darn thing with COVID-19?  I've seen these things being pointed out on some conservative/right-leaning websites, but a few news articles literally called that "disinformation."	the fact that influenza has "disappeared" is total bullshit.   I cannot believe more people (or anyone but us and a few people on Twitter) aren't questioning this.   example:   January 8th flu update for Chicago now posted.   Zero out of 10,268 PCR tests have tested positive for flu.   Zero.   https://twitter.com/EWoodhouse7/status/1349066917278056448	None	Nevertheless, flu is down.  I agree it's not caused by masks and social distancing.  Reduction in international travel is a possibility... but we had flu circulating back when international travel was slow and laborious, so it doesn't seem that likely.  I think most likely it's some kind of viral interference; that is, exposure to COVID likely reduces your chance of getting the flu.	0

I didn't even bother watching this one, but I can take a guess.  Folks, things aren't looking good. We need to do better. That's why together, we're initiating some new half assed measures that won't do much, but will appear to be something in order to halfassedly quell the fears of the masses while not upsetting my base investors. For some unexplained reason, there have been some [bad apples, hooligans, nincompoops, jerks, turkeys] not following our previous muddy and nonsensical non-rules.

gj31p3q	Is it appropriate to ask a Professor you’re doing research under if they know how to get academic books for cheaper than market price?	For what it's worth, this is not something you should expect. I have neither heard of nor considered the idea of buying books for students with research funds. Generally, professors' research funds are pretty strained as it is. *Do not* go to your professors asking for them to buy you books. ($50 of books x 60 students = $3000, which is significantly more than many folks' research budgets.) Awesome if someone wants to do that for you, but it's a wild thing to request.  Asking for advice about how to get the books cheaper, however, is entirely reasonable.	Fully reasonable to ask your professor to provide you with research materials. Good chance they have part of their budget set aside specifically for things like this.	None	Wow I didn’t realize how little funding some people get. I think everyone in my department got a £500/yr “book budget”. We could spend it on other things, but it was pretty explicitly for things exactly like this.   Also I don’t think OP was asking their prof to by books for the entire class, but for them as a research assistant. $50 of books x 5ish research assistants x “probability of research assistants requesting new books” = not that much money.	0

gj3q0xg	Just bought a C64	Given that the caps cost nearly nothing and are easy to swap, I don't really see a reason not to change them and just avoid that risk altogether. Even if it's a small one.	So if caps aren't bulging/leaking you really feel there's no need to recap? Mine haven't been powered on for 25yrs+, not sure how the current not passing through caps affects them. That and possibly dielectric drying through the years?	I haven't ever had to recap any of my C64s. A visual inspection for bulging or leaking would be a good idea, but I think they aren't generally problematic. An SD2IEC is a great place to start, it will give you access to a ton of content, but it won't emulate an actual disk drive so some software won't work with it. You'll likely also want a fast loader of some kind, either a cartridge, or a JiffyDos chip. Without one, some software can take upwards of 2 minutes to load! As far as other add-ons, the sky is the limit. There are internet wifi modems, ram expansions, stereo SID chips, video upscalers, multi-carts, hard drives, cpu boosters, you name it. If you want the most bang for your buck, take a look at a 1541 ultimate ii+ cart.	Agreed, that's why asked these questions.

gj3qkg8	Searching for a timeline creation tool.	Gephi is pretty easy to learn. I learned to use it in a day or two. Blender will take months to learn, so maybe try out Gephi and see if you can make what you want with it. It’s more for relationship graphs though, like graphing social networks and stuff, but you can change the bubble size based on data which might be what you want. I love Gephi, especially because it’s free and open source. You can find some tutorials on YouTube. It looks intimidating to learn, at first, but there aren’t too many features which makes it much easier to learn. You got this.  https://gephi.org	Perhaps something a bit less complicated? This is just a fun little project I have, not a thesis. I don't think I would have the capacity to create what I want with a tool meant for every data set imaginable (too complex for a simple task).	Um, Gephi? If all else fails, you could just model a graph in Blender and make it look literally however you want.	None	0

What did Lana do recently?   Personally one of my biggest fucking issues with her was having a book signing in a pandemic and wearing a mesh bejeweled mask... So fucking stupid and not worth my time to listen to to give money to that foolish behavior.	I agree, it's weird seeing people, many of whom are younger than Lana, try to infantilize a 35 year old woman. I refuse to accept that this recent incident of hers is people simply misconstruing her words as this kind of supposed "mis-understanding" has happened several times beforehand.

gj5rsfm	Where to go from here	No Hay Tos is great if you’re into Mexican Spanish. They have transcripts on their Patreon. It’s just two Mexican guys taking to each other about various cultural and grammatical topics. Radio Ambulante is cool, too. Free transcripts on their website, also. If you’re more into comedy, Ponte Chido and El podcast de Alex Fernández are fun and at least for me, fairly easy to understand. If you’re not into Mexican Spanish, I’m afraid I’m not much help.	Do you have any suggestions on which Podcasts to listen to?	Listening is absolutely the most important thing you can do, in my opinion.  If you aren't used to hearing spoken, conversational Spanish, I'm afraid you may be very mistaken about your proficiency level - I certainly was.  I thought I was basically fluent.  I could read and speak Spanish 99% fluently and ace any Spanish course or test, but could barely understand it when it was spoken to me.  It took months of listening to Spanish daily before it all started falling into place.  Spend as much time as you can listening.  Podcasts, TV, Netflix, etc.  Programs like Rosetta Stone are a nice introduction, but are grossly unrepresentative of what the actual language, in use, is.	None	0
gj5u8ap	Does anyone else think that Tony dosent deserve to be in hell because it's not necessarily totally his fault that he is who he is?	&gt; Most of the imagery of Hell we get is from Dante, anyway.   Actually, most of the imagery of Dante's Inferno was inspired by the Apocalypse of Peter, which was original supposed to be in the Christian Canon, alongside the other New Testament books. But it was decided by the Roman council that put together the NT that it shouldn't be included, just because it was too gruesome and upsetting, and they were afraid it would put off too many potential converts.	I don't really believe in Hell, in the Christian sense. Most of the imagery of Hell we get is from Dante, anyway.   Hell, as a concept, doesn't make much sense when applied evenly. So non-Christians are all in Hell and that would include some guy in Japan who died five years after Jesus and would never have had a shot. It also doesn't really make sense in terms of how mental illness is treated or how suicide would work in a situation where suicide is literally the only option (like being trapped on an upper floor of the WTC). It just doesn't make sense all around.  So where should Tony go? Same as everyone else. Maybe there's reincarnation or maybe it's just lights out and nothingness. You just cease to be. I don't know.	None	This isn't really an "actually" sort of comment. Was Dante inspired by the Apocalypse of Peter? Possibly. We cannot definitively say. It's not like Dante could run down to the Barnes and Noble and pick up a copy of non-canonical religious texts like you can today especially since we're talking pre-printing press.  As far as I can tell, everyone just sort of assumes that Dante read it or was taught about it and it influenced him due to similarities in the ironic punishments. However, this itself is lifted from Hellenic tradition. The idea of people being punished in the afterlife with some perfectly befitting torture is straight out of Greek mythology. So Dante could very well have picked up that influence from Classical sources just as easily.  But what influenced Dante doesn't actually matter. What I said was that most modern Christian views came from Dante and that's true irrespective of where Dante got the idea. Images of Hell which began appearing in churches to scare people into submission came out around the same  time as the Divine Comedy and many of them stuck.	0

That's why I'm hoping there's a sequel. Maybe they can try to understand each others situations better and try to forgive one another for the emotions that they experienced during tragic and world changing circumstances, in an already fucked up world that they live in. I think in time Abby may show remorse for what she did to Joel. That's why a third game needs to come in a few years to have us come full circle. And if that's the case this could be a trilogy to transcend console generations and manage to be a masterful experience in the process, if it happens that is.	Honestly I'm super inclined to agree... I think the point of no return was Mel and Owen's deaths, and even then, right at the ending, prior to Abby leaving, I'm sure Ellie could get her feelings out in the open, and Abby too, but unfortunately it can't be like that...

gjbfrmj	Corporate wokeness is downright shameful	That's part of it sure, but consider what a corporation is: Their job is to make as much money as possible. That means avoiding pissing people off and pandering to the right groups of people. The fact that corporations, risk averse as they are, are willing to pander to LGBT groups to the degree that they do shows that LGBT activists have overwhelmingly won the culture war. Corporations are not only not afraid of pissing off the remaining dissenters, but they're actively afraid of pissing off societies most vocal LGBT activists; that's cultural domination right there. If corporations are afraid of you, then you have real power.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window  I think this is pretty accurate for what you are describing happening.	I don't think that most people actually believe that corporations care about these things. They do, however, view corporations doing these sorts of things as a sign that their side is winning the culture war.

gjc8g63	Lithium and Nickel investing might switch around to Sodium Sulfur and can be a potential hit for long term investors. Sodium Sulfur Battery Market Size Worth $480.4 Million By 2027: Grand View Research, Inc.	The thing is with battery markets is we often focus on things like EV and cellphones but this ignores many other uses. When you consider the variety of chemistries even for lithium ion it’s quite possible ground will be ceded to one and another alternatives being presented now.   I don’t know enough about what drives adoption in the way you could say at this point it will take over, maybe there’s an intelligible way to identify that.   You’re absolutely right on the part about some money to be made. Vanadium stocks did very well on this same kind of news and honestly I’m not sure what happened after that.	I understand, and I am more of a fundamental investor so that is why I post data. But my posts also does say it **CAN** be something to look at in the next **15 to 20 years**. So it should come to sense to others that anything with a 15 to 20 yr forecast should be taken with a grain of salt regardless, but not ignored. But the numbers dont like, the sector has been expanding in market cap. No it is not huge, but it can bring some returns.	I realize you posted a lot of data and I don’t want to come off as rude but I think it’s worth mentioning that literally since the invention of the lithium ion people have been forecasting it’s replacement.  It takes 15 to 20 years to commercialize new battery technology, maybe with the right investment or catalyst that could be sped up but that has always been my understanding as a benchmark for transition.  Solid state batteries or even vanadium ones seem like the logical successor at first though I can’t comment on what will happen after that.   As much as people forecast cobalt being replaced it also provides essential stability in the battery that has allowed for reductions but not substitutions up until now.

gjgpaj5	Angry customer texts me after accepting an order.	&gt; if it had bounced around, then there would be no way to know before accepting   Maybe on GH or UE. But DD is incredibly hesitant with increasing pay on orders that have been bounced around. Bounced around orders tend to have payouts like $3.75 or something	If it had bounced around, then there would be no way to know it before accepting. Now, you could say "stop delivering orders with a garbage tip." That would make sense, since the immediate text about where their McDonald's food is would be a good hint that they didn't tip.	Stop accepting orders with a garbage tip	All depends on how many Dashers are available in your area. I only work the suburbs. I get a few orders each night with high DD pay, because the customer didn't tip. I can always tell, because their pick up and delivery times are pretty much immediate. I just text them to let them know I just accepted their order, and I'm heading to the restaurant. If they text back any kind of anger, then I unassign.   I only do DD and GH. UE is garbage in my area. I'm signed up, but I've never had a single order worth taking. Had it on for 5 nights. GH is nice, since you can see if the customer tipped after accepting the order. I don't really care, since I only accept when the payout is nice. It does come in handy for when you get an asshole text from them. You check and see no tip, add in the asshole attitude, and it's an easy unassign.	0
gjgyxbf	Is a temperature rise of 1 Degree in human tissue harmful?	Of course! It really depends on the area of the body. Users of heat pads routinely raise the temperature of the area being heated to 40-45°C, generally without ill effect. The brain is more temperature sensitive, with damage occurring around 42°C but only after remaining at that temperature for an extended time.	Thank you! May I ask what would be considered a harmful temperature increase?	Let's put this in context. Human body temperature is around 37°C. If a person runs a fever at 38°C, is there cause for concern?  No. A fever isn't noteworthy until it hits about 39.5°C. So no, a very temporary, localized 1° elevation in temperature isn't particularly harmful. Those who take hot baths or use steam rooms and saunas will likely raise their body temperatures just as much.	Thank you! The study only looked at 5 minute phone calls, I know it’ll probably be hard to guess but do you think if a phone calls is long enough (half an hour maybe?) that the temperature could reach a dangerous level?	0

My last boxed version of SuSE was 9.0 The first community editions (starting with 10 and then renamed to openSUSE) was a totally different product with a really rough start.	Yeah I figured. The T43 is a 2005 release, just as the Suse 10.0. But maybe thats a bit too close to be supported properly. I might have to do some research onto which Machine is supported best by it.   That being said my 10.0 is just one release away from the infamous 10.1 release which spurred great discussions due to its lack of stability and the kicker menu, if I remember correctly.	I tried installing suse 9 on a T43. It didn't go well. Even though a T43 seems old to us, I think it's a few years newer than these distros.  I would have to look at the exact years, but generally you want your Linux kernel to be newer than your laptop generation. Something like a year or two to be safe.  The technological leaps brought on were very significant with every year back then, hard for us to imagine now.	None	0

gjk12vy	Fictional map of a Wellington Subway because of the lack of railway connection across the city	WhAt aBoUt A hYpErLoOp	Would be nice, but sadly not much more realistic than this drawing.  To build proper fast rail you'd need to tunnel all the way through the Paekakariki escarpment (current only single tracked, and can't be widened), somehow remove a bunch of the level crossings (many of these are in the town centres and close to stations so would be expensive to trench/tunnel/elevate), and electrify and double track from Waikanae to Levin.  TBH, even if you did that the trains won't run much faster than they currently do, because any express service will get stuck behind all of the regular all-stops services between Waikanae and Wellington. To get around that you need to almost grade separate it up to Waikanae, probably by following the transmission gully route.  By the time you do all that, the cost will be in the same ballpark as building a Wellington underground metro system.	What we need is a fast train towards Levin. That would  - fix the housing problem since people no longer need to live close to the city - ease the CBD traffic jam (to some extend) - help the rural towns to grow with more people settling in these places	None	0

gjkmy1h	Lecturers warn they will strike if forced to resume 'unsafe' teaching	Whilst I share much of your anger, you have the wrong enemy. Lecturers are not the bad guys here they are workers being made to work in unsafe circumstances. The people to be angry at are the govt for not getting covid under control to allow us to get back to uni.	As a student who's already had parts of first-year and half of my third-year stolen by strike action, and 1 year of University stolen by COVID, I don't think I have the capacity to support more disruptions to my learning.   It's been 1.5 years of disruption at this point, while I have had to pay the full fees regardless. I had support for the lecturers before for their pension issue, but the condemnation students have had from lecturers for asking for requesting mitigating circumstances in examinations has been disgusting. Students have been labelled [terrorists](https://twitter.com/S4AMOfficial/status/1349334334877159425) and [idiots](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-55633371) by lecturers for asking for a safety net in light of the shit education we've had.  Frankly, I don't care for lecturers war against students anymore.	None	I don't understand why people are so quick to side with the academic elite over students. 1.5 years out of my 4 year course have been cancelled, frankly, lecturers have already used up my good-will allowance.

gjmhhp2	what medical specialty will see the most change in the next decade?	Rads will see a new golden age before it eventually (if ever) dies to AI. Demand for imaging will keep increasing, and the AI tools will help rads keep pumping out more RVUs faster than ever before and with less tedium (e.g. scanning for tiny lung nodules).  I'm skeptical if an AI-only read would ever even replace the AI + human radiologist centaur model. I could see the AI doing preliminary reads, but at the end of the day, I think patients and  will want a physician to be responsible and liable for reading their scans and handing them their diagnoses.	I partly disagree with this because I see radiology getting slowly replaced more and more with AI. Even interventional radiologist utilize high tech robotics that can one day be taken over with AI.	Positively: Genetics, medonc, radiology.  Genetics has become the forefront of new advancements both in terms of diagnostics and treatment and will continue to be the forefront. Same with medonc.   Outside of those two specialties, radiology has probably been one of if not the most rapidly changing specialties in terms of technology and clinical value. Many 'clinical diagnoses' now rely on imaging. Physician behaviour in terms of imaging use compared to even just 2 decades ago in the early 2000s has completely shifted as imaging has become more available and reliable.	You're right on the money here. People outside of medicine and even just outside of radiology see the way that AI is developing in other fields, like Google's Deep Mind, and assume the same is possible in Radiology. It is, but it's so far away right now that it's not a concern. When my speech recognition has a five-nines accuracy, then I'll concern myself with AI. Until then, the software vendors have shown they're not up to the task of AI	0

gjnzx7k	Idaho House rejects remote participation amid virus concerns	&gt;It's unrelated to conservatism.  I disagree. Conservatism at its heart is a distrust of change and an event like this requires lots of changes from the status quo. Combine that with absurd notions that the free market will solve every problem, belief that government can't solve any problems, and a natural hatred of scientists that have been debunking religious claims for hundreds of years and you can understand why ignoring the pandemic is a 'logical' conclusion for conservatives.  Edit: They respond the exact same way to global warming.	It's unrelated to conservatism.   What happened was a group of people got scared who were told repeatedly for the last decade~ish that the media lies, the government lies, and science isn't to be trusted. Therefore, when something that requires all 3 in order to effectively fight it... This group that believed those things got super scared.   How could they fight this evil that they can't see, and when they can't trust the politicians, the media, the scientists?  So, the fear was rationalized as anti-constitution and anti-freedom. Easy sell as the untrusted were suggesting temporary reduction of freedoms either voluntarily or by force.  and voila.	I still don't really understand why being concerned and taking reasonable precautions about a virus which has killed at least 2 million people has a strict Republican/Democrat divide.  When I used to play that Plague video game, it never occurred to me that that was a thing and that there would be so many humans on the virus's side.  Edit:  There's a representative who is a paraplegic with compromised lungs, and it's like they're mad at her for being concerned.   Why is it a political issue?   What is the value of conservatism that requires one to have disdain for others' well-being?   Can't we have reasonable debates about taxes or the economy or public lands or whatever but agree that death and illness is bad and that we'll all be better off when the pandemic is behind us?	Well I'm not going to defend conservatism but I think you are assigning current aspects of the political right with conservatism.   The difference with global warming is most refuse to admit it's real so they don't have to talk about how to fix it.  They aren't scared of global warming. They are scared of getting covid.	0

gjoqnmc	Antinatalism is illogical as it only exists because antinatalists assume everyone will suffer the same problems as them.	Antinatalism doesn’t seek to end existing lives, just prevent future ones.  The desire to limit suffering and give everyone existing as happy a life as possible is entirely compatible with antinatalism.	Antinatalism is not related to any singular problem, though.   Suffering and death are guaranteed. Its the extent and kind that are up to chance.	None	Perhaps I misunderstood then, but at the same time, it’s still entirely possible to give a new child a happy life. The problem isn’t really that more people are born, it’s just some people are raised with horrible parents for example. You can still enjoy your life knowing that death is the end, that’s something that we can all eventually come to terms with.	0

gjpdc4y	What’s the most practical weapon in your world?	In that sense, the Zapper. Think of a wireless taser. A laser pulse opens a channel of ionized air, followed by an electric discharge along that conductive path. Short range, but essentially "point and click" self defense workable by everyone. Comes with the additional benefit of being usable in any environment where you don't want to throw projectiles or high energy laser beams around.	Really, just general practicality. Civilian or battlefield. The user would be an average person, not too trained, not brain-dead.	Depends upon a couple factors, what context are we talking about. Firstly, are we looking at battlefield or civilian use? Secondly, are we fighting against highly trained opponents with well made (possibly soul bonded) weapons or are we looking at the broke guy in a back alley with a kitchen knife?	None	0
gjpfxzk	Hi, not an otherkin but this is cool	Parogenesis (a word for tulpamancy that doesn't carry that cultural appropriation baggage) is a form of plurality, as is DID. Plurality comes in many forms, and it's a great tragedy for plural people and a source of stigma that almost all mainstream plural representation is DID. DID is a traumagenic and disordered form of plurality, and many plural people have to intrdouce themselves by saying "by the way, my plurality isn't caused by trauma and it's entirely healthy".	Tulpamancy sounds like DID, honestly.	None	None	0

gjps9cc	Why no Cold War carrier conversions?	They also realized the cold war wouldn't be won by carriers.  Had the cold war gone hot, it would have been fought with ICBMs, planes and tanks. It was extremely unlikely that the European militaries would need carriers for anything other than proxy wars, simply because they wouldn't be fighting away from their own land, and airfields are much cheaper than carriers. It's also much harder to torpedo an airfield.	There really wouldn't have been any point. The Royal Navy had two brand-new *Audacious*-class fleet carriers (*Ark Royal* and *Eagle*) and six *Centaur*-class light carriers in the yards, plus a few other ships in the works.   There were also the relatively new fleet carriers *Implacable* and *Indefatigable*, amongst various other old and new fleet and light carriers. In fact, the British had more carriers than they needed and sold/gave away carriers to France, the Netherlands, Australia, and Canada.  The British didn't have the money (or the need) to keep the carriers they already had, finish the ships they had in the yards, or even contemplate converting new carriers.	None	None	0

I dont think selfish is the right term. Maybe naive or idealistic would be more appropriate?

You can still find classic starchy crops on the markets, but they are a luxury item. The main source for carbohydrates these days is the kudzu that is planted by the bioremediation program on a massive scale to stabilize the remaining topsoil.

Curious as to why QTo is in your 3b bluff range. Pretty much every hand that calls your 3b has you dominated.  Bet bigger on the flop. $13 into $44 is under 30% of pot, you're gonna get called here like 100% of the time.  On the turn you definitely can fold. You're calling a pot sized reraise with much less than 50% equity. I also think a raise here is better than a jam on the river when you miss (which is what I assume happened). I think a call is pretty bad too because you'll hit the river only 15% of the time. I'd probably fold this though	None	None	0

I haven't watched the video yet but in the defense of not eating dogs, eating meat eaters is a huge waste of resources compared to eating plant eaters.

I agree with Vaush on his views on veganism, it is the moral, health, and environmentally best option. I live mostly vegetarian (only meat when I eat out and even then not much).	0

I feel like it should be a human right to take your own life. Not condoning suicide or anything, but if I wanted to jump, he wouldn't be doing me any good. Never wanted to kill myself though, such a dumb mindset.	None	I'll explain it for him.  If someone is truly content with going forth in their decision, and they are at a stable mental state to think, they should not be physically obstructed and forced to live when they have made their own personal decision.  This isn't encouraging suicide, just worded poorly above. If someone is ill mentally at no point should they ever be told suicide is an option. Help to continue living will always be the support. But if they have received support (medication, therapy, sessions etc) and they do not feel improvement, then ultimately what they do is their decision. We can discourage them, reach out a hand, but shouldn't force people to suffer.	0
gjr6c4c	Efilism: a parody of anti-natalism or serious(ly bad) philosophy?	Maybe I’m misunderstanding, but to me, it sounds like:   &gt;one who also believes that ending existing sentient life should be sought after   Is pro-mortalism   And  &gt;one who believes that current life should take its natural course until death eventually catches up  Is antinatalism	> he argument for anti-natalism already extends to all sentient life  So, I'd like to talk about two things that stem from this.  1)  just to confirm for consistency. If the above holds true, you'd agree that:  - "Sentiocentric" antinatalism is really just antinatalism  - "Anthropocentric" antinatalism is actually natalism coupled with specism  2) how would you go about distinguishing between these two antinatalists, both of whom believe no sentient life should continue to procreate: one who also believes that ending existing sentient life should be sought after and one who believes that current life should take its natural course until death eventually catches up.	None	I agree and that sounds like a definition-consistent assessment.  The way I see it, the groups of individuals I see interact with the hangout subreddit are those who believe, separately:  - that birth is okay (okay here meaning positive or neutral)  Vs  - that some categories of human birth is wrong while others are okay  Vs  - that all human birth is wrong but otherwise birth is okay.  Vs  - that all birth is wrong but otherwise hassening life's end isn't a good thing  Vs  - that all birth is wrong and finding the strength to end life is the next best thing to preventing it  And  For each of the above, a subdivision of whether that belief holds for under only certain conditions (i.e. would change in a utopia) or whether they are on principle and immutable.	0

gjr8p11	Even compared to games from 2002, Cyberpunk underdelivers	Well, that would mean they crunch workers for another 2 years. But what actual incentive do they have? Even with the refunds and such, the game sold like hotcakes. The executives and managers who orchestrated this whole debacle got to reap the rewards.	It's just incredible. Even if there were no bugs, performance issues, or crashes, the game is still massively underdeveloped. It's very clear to me that this game needed another 1.5 to 2 years of development time.   I think Jason Schrieier's reporting on this is accurate, and that the game was rushed out the door with many employees originally thinking that 2022 was a soft target date for release.   The problem with CDPR is that they're not acknowledging any of this. They apologized for the bugs and performance problems and the lack of transparency in that regard, but apparently they think no other major issues exist with the game. I just want to seem them come out and admit that the game is not done and they will fix all of this, especially stuff like the AI (hard to believe it's as bad as it is).	I should quit this subreddit for the next year until they (maybe) fix all these glaring issues and obvious short cuts...  It's not just the bugs, its the obvious lack of polish on the game.

gjrer1j	Random Encounters in Travel/Resting Rules	Swamps where black dragons often reside can feasibly be near enough to a desert that a black dragon could travel to one, especially as they're fast creatures that could potentially have a hunting area around their lair of some 300 square miles.	Youre in the middle of the desert. Look out, black dragon.	While this looks cool, as a player, sometimes the random encounters are too "random", they make no sense. Make your encounters connected to the world. And sometimes non combat (or optional combat) encounters while traveling are much more fun. I'm not saying that you shouldn't have random encounters, but put effort into them. This is coming from a player, who loves combat.	None	0
gjrg5i6	How does this light look?	If you are going with cheaper Chinese LED lights that aren't using Samsung LM series diodes then you want to go with 40-50 true watts per square foot of space.  So, if you have a 4x4 tent, that is 16 square feet, and would require 640-800 watts.  If you go with higher quality LED lights then you want to go with 30-40 watts per square foot.	Right you are. I found one with 180 true watts. Would that be good enough or is 600 really the least I wanna have?	And I just briefly read one of the reviews, it wasn't even for the light listed. Review was for a Mars hydro light which is found on Amazon	Gotcha.

Maybe it might ring a bell for you?  It's a story from the perspective of someone turning into a zombie [(but it's not *The Sweetness*)](https://pseudopod.org/2015/07/03/pseudopod-445-sweetness/). I remember a line about them following the rest of the zombie herd like being swept along by a huge wave.

My most memorable:  - **[The Cord-](https://pseudopod.org/2011/10/21/pseudopod-252-the-cord/)** TLOU before TLOU was a thing, or at least while it was still in development.  - **[The Things-](https://escapepod.org/2011/06/23/ep298-the-things/)** (Escape pod the sister podcast). *The Thing* written from the thing's perspective, it's as cool as it sounds.

gjruu33	[OC] whoops	I was using a legendary sword and he still took me way more tries than Smasher.	It's not you.  The last guy is like 30x more difficult than Adam Smasher.  * Tiny ring * Even with all Legendary armor, subdermal armor, multiple health boosting implants, decent points put into Body and Street Brawling, he still two-hit KOs me. * A successful block barely reduces hit damage * Shrugs off damage * Wonky hit detection  I barely beat Rhino, and that was after I had to fight her AGAIN after I almost had her down when I dodged into the fighting pit ladder and my V decided to try to climb it.  So she recovered and wailed on me.	Wait, you can do that? I really don't like these missions, maybe because I just suck, or maybe because the combat system is really unpleasant and confusing. If this works, then I will also make sure not to accidentally drop a weapon and then accidentally pick it up.	None	0
gjrvglc	19M and about to get 50k+, wtf am i supposed to do?	Absolute entry level there's [Amazon Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/) and other options on /r/beermoney.	I don't have any advice on what you can do with the money. But in terms of work, there's plenty of entry-level jobs that can be done remotely on a computer. Have you thought about targeting these rather than shelf-stacking etc? Clearly you're more than happy typing away, maybe that might be more up your street in terms of work?  Sorry if it's an obvious/unhelpful suggestion, but i think many young people without much work experience still don't quite realise what the job market is like.  Also, I'm really sorry to hear about your dad. Seems like a decent fella making sure he's providing for you even after he passes away.	None	None	0
gjrwmji	What are these tabs on siege magnus for? They don’t seem to attach to anything during transformation.	They don’t come anywhere near connecting anything in robot mode, but this gives me an idea. Does anyone know whether siege galaxy Optimus uses these for his leg panels?	They're meant to be another connection of the leg panels while in robot mode. Kinda useless tho since they don't do that.	None	In fact, they do use those tabs in that version of the mold.

gjry72o	Kratom makes no fucking sense to me.	8 grams as a first timer is way too high. Assuming I don’t have a tolerance built up, 8g would absolutely make me vomit.	Take 8. It'll have you feeling good, Don't take it more than 3 days in a row and only re-dose 3 times a day MAX taking only 8 at most at a time. Hardest issue is keeping your tolerance low, Follow those guidelines and you'll be fine, Sorry about the other commenter, Don't listen to google, it won't fuck up your liver, plenty have gotten liver readings and say nothings changed after years of use. Can it be abused? Yup, Which is why you should follow the guidelines I just listed. The reason I say take 8 is because at max you have 000 Capsules, One 000 capsule is equivalent to about 1 gram. So, if you took 5 you most likely took 5 grams or less, won't do much. 8 grams is about the dosage most go with. Not too much not too little, however each person is built a little differently, You may have to experiment a bit before finding the right dosage for yourself, just don't over do it.	None	None	0

gjs8k53	Lab-grown meat stocks?	I'm a vegan and I would eat it. I probably wouldn't make a habit out of it, because it would just be weird after three decades of not eating flesh it would just be weird. However, I'm curious and see no ethical issue with it if they can make it without harming or killing any animals. Most vegans aren't necessarily against eating meat -- they are against animal cruelty and exploitation.	Hahah! Youre not wrong though! No animals will be harmed but I doubt vegans would ever eat it. I think we will see a new category of vegans emerge that agree to eat lab grown meat since no animals are being harmed. Maybe they are just not ready for that kind of technology or ultimatum yet...	Don’t mention this to the vegan sub.  I triggered the shit out of them by saying this should be their focus to help the animals in the future.	Thanks for the response and view point. I understand veganism is more because of animal cruelty than anything else and it would be interesting to see the new culture that emerges of”lab grown meat only” consumers. Hey, as long as its ethical, safe, is better for animals and cuts down on green house gas emissions, I would get behind it	0

gjs9f5b	Enlisting with a 3.4 GPA and STEM degree. Will I regret this?	She has a vested interest in making sure you enlist.   A Navy enlisted recruiter only recruits enlisted. If she made it sound like officer was a good deal for you, she'd lose a recruit to someone else.  A 3.4 isn't low at all when it comes to officer recruiting. You probably have a better shot than you think you do.	She said its possible, but mentioned GPA is on low side.	You should talk to an officer recruiter to get a good idea, but officer is much better than enlisted in terms of quality of life and pay.  Contact an officer recruiter.	None	0

My bad for saying we shouldn't kill people for trivial bs. I know that is a radical and controversial statement.	Said like a typical Communist.  No thanks.	> Best part? Nobody is going to miss them. After all, they're worthless scum, the absolute not-even-scrape-worthy material at the bottom of a barrel.  I mean, I don't love theifs. I wish it wasn't a thing.   However, these are people at the end of the day. And the vast majority of property crime is motivated by poverty, inequality, and lack of opportunity. Your comment regarding these people is pretty dehumanizing. I get the anger towards these individuals; however, I don't get the dehumanizing and wanting to murder them aspect.  Like, human life > material things.	Trivial BS?  Interesting thought process.   How about when robbers kill people inside their own homes, and the case becomes cold?  No thanks. They get what they fucking deserve. Also, no one is going to miss them. So, why the hell not?	0

gjswjak	What are some more polite alternatives in English to "do you understand what I'm saying?" or "does what I'm saying make sense?" What might be some more polite versions of these?	Hmm, that might depend on what kind of thing you were saying before hand. Could you give me an example of a situation where you wanted to say something like this but weren’t sure what to say?	Thx, I am curious of one thing tho.   Let's say you are taking to a teacher or TA or someone with some authority over you. Do you think "don't you think?" or "you know?" will still sound polite in those situations? I am not sure	I wonder if you are trying to find a replacement for the French “d’accord”, which I have often wished would make the leap to English. For that, I have found “...don’t you think?” often captures a similar vibe.   I find “... you know?” works well in casual situations. And “Does that make sense to you?” for more formalized settings where you are actively educating someone.	In a situation where you think a teacher or TA made an error, and you are trying to lead them step by step to recognize that error by asking them probing questions.   A: Its this way  B: Hmm.. I don't think so. Take a look at this. This piece of evidence implies something else  A: \[doesn't seem to understand\] or just says "no its this way"   B: What I'm trying to ask/point out is X. Do you understand what I'm asking/don't you think?   &#x200B;  Basically I am just trying to make sure that this "you know?" or "don't you think?" doesn't come across as mocking someone, especially if they see themselves as above you/more knowledgeable than you	0
gjsxj7k	What would you do? I was not having it with this person. Sorry about it!	If I had a sleeping infant or a barking dog, I'd put instructions not to knock. Otherwise I would assume someone would want me to knock.  Package delivery guys deliver me packages sometimes and don't knock and I hate it. Sometimes I don't notice I have a package until the next day.	Youre not making any sense. Imagine having a sleeping infant and a barking dog. Would you really want the delivery person to wake up your baby for your cheeseburger delivery? Think first. It doesnt take much to do so.	You should knock and/or ring the doorbell every time unless the notes specify otherwise. This is a normal and expected thing to do. It's bizarre to me that this is even controversial. It's like 0.0001% extra effort on your part and it makes perfect sense. Most people would want you to do that.  Edit: I can't fucking believe people are downvoting the idea that it's normal to knock when you're delivering something to someone. Weird.	At least someone has common sense. I used to get negative reviews until I started knocking and ringing doorbells. People who don't want that bc of babies or barking dogs leave a delivery note surprisingly. Don't let antisocial redditors make it sound like it's normal to not knock or something lmao.	0
gjsxz81	Shipping from US	It sounds like you answered your own question! You can either pay double the price in Europe or you can pay double the price to ship it over including the customs fees and tax. Either way you end up paying double!  I'm in the same boat by the way, I had to pay £50 for a squirt ps4 and £100 for a rebar, from a UK distributor. I looked at getting one imported from the US and it wasn't any cheaper when considering shipping and taxes.	No man, anything with more than 20 Euros declared coming from US will be taxed in almost 100% of the value. So it doesnt make any sense to ship from US since it will be more than what I would pay buying here	I would just declare it at its full value. Better safe than sorry, and knowing us customs they will return to sender instead of dealing with it	None	0
gjsyi1y	SARMs with DNP	Ya it would but it’s a waste in my opinion because Cardarine + DNP prioritizes fat for fuel and your workouts will be so shit you won’t make much use of it anyway	Cardarine and DNP it is. But wouldn't Ostarine on a DNP cycle prevent any muscle loss or is it insignificant?	I’ve used it with both. DNP makes you drag ass, you end up needing a ton of stims to function especially when you get to lower bfs.  It really depends on your goals. If it’s fat loss I would take the Cardarine and DNP while skipping the Ostarine. If it’s muscle building, I would recommend just the Ostarine. If you want some kind of recomp I would recommend the Cardarine and Ostarine and skip the DNP.  Unlike DNP, Cardarine doesn’t burn much fat on its own. You have to do cardio, it just makes cardio much easier.	None	0

I used to think Doepfer modules were cheap considering the plastic jacks and lack of crazy wow features (like the intellijel rubicon2 for ex).
