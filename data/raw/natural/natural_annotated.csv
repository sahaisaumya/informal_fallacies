There may be pets you think are cute and beautiful, but it is a disgusting things stuck in a chain of horrible events. Your think that baby cow is adorable?

I also do not agree with either of your two statements about human behavior going “against nature.”

There are many examples of animals besides humans that use primitive forms of medicine, usually just eating a leaf of a plant when to help with any ailments, and most all of our medicines are directly from a natural product or synthesized based off of a natural product. I assume by artificial living spaces you mean climate control and lights and the such, and I have to agree with you there are no animals I can think of that do this.

As for your statement about behavior, there is no such thing as a behavior, on the population or community level, that “goes against nature.” If a behavior is not beneficial, it will cease to exist, or at least make the individual with a maladaptive behavior less fit, decreasing its prevalence. Human behavior is particularly interesting as we have a highly connected society and cultures. Your fight-or-flight statement is an example of this. Both fighting or flighting are “encouraged” depending on what situation the stressed individual is in. Humans do not promote fighting because there are negative repercussions for it.

Appeal to nature is an easy trap to fall into, but I think anthropocentrism is even more dangerous and easy to slip into.

Just because it is incredibly hard to decide what is right it does not follow that there is not right answer. Quite often when making this argument, an author will create a simple situation with a very complicated decision to make. The author uses the example of Sophie's choice. In Sophie's choice we have three data points: Sophie has children, Sophie has to choose which go to a work camp and which won't, and the ones that don't go to the work camp.

Maybe little Johnny likes to torture animals and little Sarah has terminal cancer. Information like this would impact the choice considerably.

The other issue is this idea that we have to ""like"" the morally correct choice. ""Rightness"" is independent of desire. Making the right choice is often that least desirable choice. In Sophie's choice it is unlikely she would like any of the options but it does not follow that it means there is no right answer.

There is also a second part to that question, the claim that all hierarchies must be abolished/destroyed because the are inherently evil/oppressive or only predicated on power (witch is also wrong, but I digress).

Now, Jordan's answer to the first part is that that claim cannot be true given the fact that hierarchies are vastly used as a form of societal organization by other species apart from humans, and he specifically picks lobsters as an example because they have a hierarchal societal structure and are really old as an species, they are also rather different life forms compared to humans/animals so they serve as a good contrast to Jordan's point.

Regarding the quote I posted, it paints the whole lobster idea as a naturist defense of sexism/male superiority, witch is not Jordan's view at all and objectively wrong (as the writer addresses with the existence of matriarchal based hierarchies).

An appeal to nature is an argument or rhetorical tactic in which it is proposed that ""a thing is good because it is 'natural', or bad because it is 'unnatural'"".  It can be a bad argument, because the implicit (unstated) primary premise ""What is natural is good"" typically is irrelevant, having no cogent meaning in practice, or is an opinion instead of a fact.  In some philosophical frameworks where natural and good are clearly defined in a specific context, the appeal to nature might be valid and cogent.

Research also indicates that, while chocolate cravings are prevalent in the West, they’re not common at all in many Eastern countries. There are also differences in how urges for different foods are communicated and understood; only two-thirds of languages have a word for cravings, and in most cases, this word only relates to drugs, and not food.

Research has found that one of the most effective ways to curb cravings is to cut the craved food from our diet – The researchers say their findings show that, in order to reduce cravings, people should eat the food they crave less often – possibly because our memories associated with that food fade over time.
