Argument from tradition is a logical fallacy.

The King James version originally translated and published those books---but placed them in the appendix. IIRC, this was the practice of all Protestants through to the 19th century or so. ",None,"At the broadest level, that's cogent only insofar as tradition is merely human tradition and authority is merely human authority. Also, and speaking only discursively, if both parties hold to a tradition or an authority, appealing to it is not a fallacy. 

Both Protestants and Catholics hold that God is the author of scripture and that, at least to some degree, church leaders have some kind of binding authority from God, though Protestants say it is subordinate to the authority of scripture, mediated wholly through scripture. Thus, a Catholic, relying on the Protestant's shared acceptance of the Gospels, may argue for the Deuterocanon/Apocrypha based on Gospel passages which quote the Deuterocanon/Apocrypha. 

This principle's main difficulty is not a fallacy, but that, if applied universally, there is trouble when an authoritative book like Jude apparently quotes a non-canonical source as authoritative.

Self-teaching can get you far and I agree with you that disagreeing voices shouldn't be dismissed immediately. Everyone deserves their fair shot, so the article she wrote about The China Study was met with a generous [response by T. Colin Campbell](https://nutritionstudies.org/minger-critique/), who pointed out quite a bit of flawed argumentation on her part. So not only does she have no credentials, she also has a history of publishing articles on the basis of incompetent interpretation, possibly as a direct result of not having an education in a field that deals with epidemiological analysis, damaging her credibility in return. And if it was only one article then you could say that people make mistakes, but the [dishonesty and hypocrisy in her work is rampant](http://plantpositive.com/blog/2012/3/26/response-to-denise-minger-1-scrupulous.html).

The article about *How not to Die*, from glossing over it, has the same issues, some examples:

* She completely misses the point about Kempner's rice diet: It is not an argument for whole food eating, it is about the result of removing high fat animal foods responsible for the build up of insulin resistance. The point is that even an unhealthy plant-based diet can see results by eliminating the underlying cause of a disease. Minger pointing out that Greger's term for whole food is subject to the studies that agree with his overall view is a bit of a strawman here.

* She spins this intricate web of critiques and weird P-values as a borderline conspiracy theory to discredit Greger's cited meta-analysis on Omega-3 supplements as cherry-picked, then cites a study that doesn't necessarily disagree with the other study's findings. Her argument then becomes that the authors of her paper recommend eating fish, a position that Greger's cited study never considered nor contested, as it was reviewing the effectiveness of supplements, not whole fish. So what is her argument even about here?

This is definitely not a black-and-white issue, as you said this is complicated and she does raise some valid points about Dr. Greger, for he is known to over-exaggerate. I do not think he tries to be dishonest, he is simply trying to put the vast amount of information into layman's terms and simplify it. I can see why you're upset that someone might dismiss Minger on an appeal to authority but after the information I provided I hope you can see that it is equally easy to dismiss her simply due to her past work not meeting scientific standard in competence and honesty. Either way I disagree with the downvotes you received.

Ultimately, you’re not going to become an exceptional chemist without a degree in it but this is the best place to start",None,"They never said wikipedia wasn't accurate. They said that wikipedia is often written at a higher level not conducive to learning.

However, by their statement, someone with a degree could still be a bad chemist. It's not an argument to authority, it's a statement that chemistry requires a lot of book learning that is, by a vast majority, only obtained by getting a degree. If you want to argue that you don't need the degree to get that book learning, that's fine but you can't argue that it's invalid on logical fallacy grounds and I would argue that they also covered that possibility by referencing several places to look to gain that knowledge outside of a university.
