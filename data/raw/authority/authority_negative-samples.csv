f8cca5r	Rest of the world, what have you always wanted to ask an American but never dared to?	Unless you're involved in gang activity the US is plenty safe.  The majority of our violent crime and murder is localized in a handful of neighborhoods that are so violent that they slant the whole country's stats.

Is it possible that some criticisms of the conspiracy subculture are valid, though?	**Submission Statement:** So I googled the keyword **"r/conspiracy"** today and this article was one of the top results.

f8uy8vm	Pay no attention to Ghislaine Maxwell, citizen. All is good. Keep watching television. Nothing to see here.	maybe, just maybe, they are directed by the same folks...	> And behind it all, the CIA was using Epstein  Mossad  https://www.mintpressnews.com/ari-ben-menashe-jeffrey-epstein-ghislaine-maxwell-israel-intelligence/262162/	And behind it all, the CIA was using Epstein to blackmail public figures.  Isn't it coincidental how both the presidential candidates in 2016 had close ties to Epstein?      There apparently are lots of Americans who enjoy watching TV shows where the CIA protects us from the bad guys.  Personally, I don't like watching reality where the CIA exploits underage women to blackmail public figures with statutory rape.    I don't think CIA officers are the bad guys.  I think they're the worst guys.	None	0

Utilitarianism and consequentialism seem to be the best ethical standards to me.   My problem with other ethical systems is they forget the point of ethics.

fbksopm	Adults of Reddit, what advertisement or marketing campaigns made you "need" to have a product or service?	The news about people attacking and stabbing each other over the sandwiches is what made me want to try them. Not any advertising that I saw. If people were going that crazy they must be good.	Wasnt really a need to buy but we decided to try the popeyes chicken sandwich because it looked alright on tv.   It was meh. Same problems I have with every other fast food chicken sandwich. They charge way to much for a single piece of chicken with two pickles and a bun. Needed cheese and tomatoes and lettuce.   Just goes to show that fast food places kind of suck when it comes to sandwiches.	None	I can get that.

fc5by3x	Shadowverse anime airs Spring 2020, cast and PV revealed	Just curious, do you feel the same way YGO isn't about the in universe card game lore? Outside of a few arcs like the isekai arc in GX, they don't ever talk about the card lore in YGO shows.  Nobody really cares about the story in Shadowverse, or other card games.  Vanguard dabbled a bit in it, but most card game anime are about playing the game itself for a reason.	I'm still super annoyed that they aren't adapting the (interesting and not Yu-Gi-Ohish) story mode or building on the actual characters in the game.	None	It's more that story mode in Shadowverse is basically a visual novel with card games in between, complete with voice lines, established characters, and deep lore. So it seems like a waste to throw that all away and just make a generic Yu-Gi-Oh clone or shonen instead. Like, could you imagine if Hearthstone got an anime adaptation and they _didn't_ set it in the WoW universe? There would be riots.  Yu-Gi-Oh, on the other hand, started as a TV show and spawned the card game. So I think that gets a pass.  For what it's worth, the Magic: The Gathering animated series eventually coming to Netflix will use the in-game planeswalkers, and that's a good thing—why _wouldn't_ the show's creators use 25 years of storytelling, history, and lore to their advantage?	0

fcj8b79	Sakuga Blog - Animation Awards 2019 Day One: Best Episode, Opening & Ending, And Creator Discovery	Beastars	> Really? Carole & Tuesday OP 1 is the most mentioned for OP of the year? It is not that bad of an OP, but it is far from OP of the year.  Care to name something more impressive? the borderless water color style in the OP's animation is quite unique and I'd dare to say it's more elaborate than lets say something shonen style like Fire Force's OP for instance. Not to mention the careful thought on color choices on the very different enviroments. The cut where Tuesday spins around and the background rotates it's quite impressive as a final work.  This OP looks like a tailored work for web animator(s), not a very run of the mill over the top OPs we've seen throught the year that despite being elaborate feel pretty common.	Really? Carole & Tuesday OP 1 is the most mentioned for OP of the year? It is not that bad of an OP, but it is far from OP of the year.      Well at least someone recognised Wataten episode 12 greatness	Beastars OP is nice for using stop motion animation, but it's hardly anything amazing to consider it among the best OPs this year.

fcl7vmy	JC Staff producer: "More than half the revenue for Index, High Score Girl, One Punch Man, Food Wars, and KonoSuba was from international streaming."	To be fair that's "contracts", not streaming.  And to be even more fair, that list puts Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China as different "countries".  China doesn't see it that way.	Everybody is saying that it's all China, and certainly they're a key player, but per the most recent data we have, [China was the sixth in the number of series licensed](https://imgur.com/a/80pSxWQ): at least as of 2018, the US, S Korea, Taiwan, France, and Canada were all larger.	And 90% of that international revenue is china	> To be fair that's "contracts", not streaming  It's a bit ambiguous, but I'm pretty sure licenses for streaming count as contracts.  Also, HK is one thing, but Taiwan has more sovereignty and is effectively independent, even if its status is contested.	0

fcxwptv	Do symptoms of pregnancy classify as GBI?	Do you have any legal proof that it would fit under the legal definition? The issue is that its so subjective and that in individual cases, the jury could go either way sometimes.	I would certainly classify the injuries received in birthing GBI. You loose a significant amount of blood, you experience extreme amounts of pain, and your vagina is damaged to the point that many women need many stitches. If someone did to you in the street what birth does to a woman, I hope most people would be outraged at the great bodily harm done to you. I find it fair to consider it GBI also in the case of birth, even if most people are desensitized to the issue since they have so often heard of people giving birth.  Of course this is all separate from the myriad of difficult and highly harmful side effects that pregnancy can cause, such as pregnancy-induced strokes, pelvis injuries which reduce your mobility, and the like. The above are the ones that are guaranteed to happen if people are forced to give birth.	None	Ah, sorry, you indeed asked for the legal definition, whereas I put forth my personal viewpoint.   I have no background in law so that is difficult to say for me, but I had a look at Dutch law (my country). Of course it has not been previously described as GBI, since the fetus is not considered a person for the law, so it is a bit of a non-issue for the law. But for what I can find in Dutch law, grievous bodily harm is difficult to define, and there is some freedom for the judge to decide if it is in fact GBI. Usually there has to be either an element of breaking of the skin (so not a bruise, for example, and a broken tooth also not usually GBI), or it has to be an injury which requires surgery. And it is usually harm which either never heals completely, or has a long and perhaps painful healing time. Also, it matters whether there is any scarring that the victim carries with them.   The below link mentions a case on the border, where the Dutch High Court agreed the damage was indeed grievous bodily harm: the assailant through a beer can at the victim, which caused a cut of 4-5 cm above the eyebrow and required stitching. This left a permanent scar on the face.  I would say based on this that birth is also GBI, since it breaks the skin and usually needs many stitches. Especially a C-section (i.e. birth requires surgery) will leave a permanent scar and has a long painful healing process. And of course there are many other permanent injuries that can occur in pregnancy and birth, such as permanent pelvis injury.  \* [https://www.daamen-advocaten.nl/wat-is-zwaar-lichamelijk-letsel-hoge-raad/](https://www.daamen-advocaten.nl/wat-is-zwaar-lichamelijk-letsel-hoge-raad/)   Psychological issues are currently not considered of form of grievous bodily harm in Dutch Law. A bit unfortunate in my opinion since that can take much longer to heal. But I guess it would be covered by other legal terms.	0

fd0uz2l	Pelosi Statement on Urgency for Fair Senate Trial	If her strategy is to uphold the Constitution, she would  1. Deliver the articles that the House voted for to the Senate, as is her job 2.

Because it is literally written to be the opposite of that.  Go on now, show some integrity and admit that you didn't really think that through.	Ive been listening to pundits on the middle / left and they keep saying they dont think Pelosi is managing the impeachment process well and that theyre confused about her strategy. Well, I think shes doing an outstanding job and her strategy is simply to uphold the US constitution.

I'm very sorry if you, as a person who has been through the foster care system and adoption process, were offended in any way by my comment or thought that I was trivializing the struggles that many children in foster care have to go through. I was merely suggesting that it is preferable to abortion of the fetus.	I just want to ask a question to OP and Im not asking this in a hateful or hurtful way: have you as a human being been in the foster care system?

ff7rwt5	It doesn't matter the how small the thing is or what name have if is the same thing	Killing cells isn't the same as killing a fetus. The fetus is an independent organism with the potential for life, whereas the cells are not. The fetus also contains a unique DNA sequence to that of its mother. At 8 weeks, many fetuses can respond to outside stimulus. The fetus has a heart, lungs, eyes etc. The cell does not.  I understand that you may not find these arguments compelling to call the fetus a person, but comparing fetuses to cells is making a false equivalency and completely dismissing key pro life arguments without rebutals. If you are going to use an example, I suggest using one that also fits the characteristics above.	>The only differents between embryons, fetus, and baby is that they have a different size/name  This is factually incorrect. A fetus before 24 weeks is incapable of being a person; as in it is incapable of being sentient and conscious. After this point it is.   >Sorry, is still a human, even if is small or have 2 weeks, i still a human.  Being human doesn't matter. I kill human cells and tissue all the time. The question is on value, I see no logical reason for society to value a fetus before its capable of being a person.   Do you value a car without an engine as much as a car with an engine? So you value a seed as much as a tree? Do you value an egg the same amount as you value a chicken?	None	> Killing cells isn't the same as killing a fetus.  All a fetus before 24 weeks is is cells and tissue. So what else is being killed other than that.  > The fetus is an independent organism with the potential for life, whereas the cells are not.

Yes, cells and tissue exists. I grant that already. Each of those organs are made of cells. No one cell is an eye just like no one eye is a whole human body...

ff8zitu	"Horseshoe Theory"	Well, centrists aren't the guy in the middle. This post is simply evidence that the people who identify as far left don't see themselves as extremists, they see their position as rational and they perceive centrists to be right-wing. Extremists on the right do the same and call centrists lefties.  The post is highlighting the stupidity of extremists through their ignorance and distorted view of reality. For example, a centrist can be a fan of Bernie or Corbyn if their policies aren't too extreme. In the UK labour wanted to increase tax by 5p on the £1 for everyone earning over 80k a year (top 5%). This plan isnt extreme and thus can be supported by someone in the middle.   This graphic intentionally chooses to compare two positions that clearly don't equate.

ffd8m42	The morality of killing the unborn is not particularly relevant in the question of abortions legal status.	First of all, to address your comment implying that fetuses are not "individuals" that's something that is a separate argument. You said that the morality of killing the unborn fetus is not relevant, but the morality would hinge upon the personhood of the fetus. If morality were not an issue in abortions, and the only issue is whether it benefits society at large, we could assume that even if the fetus is deemed a person abortion would be just. So in response to my question, we shouldn't make the distinction between individuals and fetuses to stick with your original post.  The death penalty is meant to kill people who comitted crimes. Nobody is saying that we should execute innocent people; this is merely a consequence of a system meant to do something completely different from utilitarian abortions.  Moreover, there are some people who may support neither abortions nor the death penalty. That's the issue with saying that if you support y you must support x, because there will always be someone who doesn't support y. There may be people who think that human life should never be killed even if its for utilitarian purposes.	>This is the justificaiton for the death penalty.   The problem is that we now know we have executed innocent people. And we know that more and more we are exonerating people. Some estimates are 4% of death row inmates are not guilt.   We also know that the death penalty is not administered evenly, black people get the death penalty far more often than white people who commit similar crimes.    The fact that we know both of these factors make the death penalty immoral.    >Should the government be allowed to kill inocents who comitted no crime for utilitarian reasons?   Individuals? No. Fetuses? Yes.	The distinction is that in the examples you mentioned (e.g. death penalty) the person comitted a crime. This is the justificaiton for the death penalty. This is the reason why you can't give the death penalty to people who are not deemed criminally responsible for their actions (for example, people with intelligence too low or mental illnesses that inhibit their decision making skills are seen as not capable to make such a decision, and therefore they cannot be guilty). Essentially, we use these methods as punitive measures against people whom we, as a society, have deemed "not fit to live," such as murders, rapists etc. Plus, there's the fact that people can be pro-life and not support the death penalty.  Even if you don't think that killing the fetus is a negative to society, if we allow killing of lives that did not comitt a crime, it sets a bad prescedent. Should the government be allowed to kill inocents who comitted no crime for utilitarian reasons?	This isn't about supporting the death penalty. This is about permitting it... and we do, and regardless of its intention, it does, in fact, kill innocent people, which we agree is immoral.    So our implication if the death penalty is immoral but permitted.	0
ffhhb32	Emotional Schiff Speech Goes Viral, Delighting the Left and Enraging the Right	Considering the House's case in the senate is to call witnesses and force the white house to give up material evidence that it is withholding, the case is literally not airtight or even 'made'.

fg1aydz	Why is the bodily autonomy argument taken seriously in this debate?	In fact, I would argue that violating someone's body autonomy for their own safety is even more of a violation compared to someone else's safety. You could argue that someone else should decide about whether they want to lose their life, but it would be harder to argue in favour that you have agency over someone else's life.	> we already had prioritized peoples lives over their autonomy in the past, with psych wards, forced blood test, forced vaccinations court ordered blood transfusions and etc  In those situation, you are prioritising the person's own life over their bodily autonomy. That's very different to prioritising someone else's life.  If we go with prioritising the lives of others over the bodily autonomy of individuals, it should be legal for hospital staff to grab someone off the street, cut out all their non-essential organs (spare kidney, spare lung, lobe of liver, bone marrow) and use those parts to save the lives of patients.

Do you think a fetus has a similar level of agency as a severely mentally handicapped person?

fi6i26v	Hannah Arendt was a pseudo-intellectual who only pretended to hold her beliefs for attention.	I am a fan of arendt and she was faking it sometimes. There is plenty of literature discussing her bouncing between identifying as an American or a citizen of the world and a liberal depending on what point she wants to make, and then other times she fully identified as a Jew, was a conservative and a Zionist. I still like her, and realising this about her taught me a lot about politics. Perhaps faking it is too strong a condemnation. She changed her mind frequently which was understandable given her life, she was human and didn't even allow herself to be pegged down as something even by herself.	I'm not a huge fan of Arendt, but it's not like she was faking it. She really believed what she said (whether that's always a point in her favor, I'll let you decide), and to assert otherwise is just conspiratorial nonsense.

fknhrj7	The closing of supposed healing sites like Lourdes proves that there is no validity to the healing claims	he's saying even the faithful have lost their faith in the magic but it's probably the charlatans running the sites who know better...	I know very, very few Christians (or religious folk in general) who believe in faith healing, or sacred healing sites or junk like that.  >  the fact that even Christians don't believe Lourdes can heal anything shows that religion is useless when it comes to practicality  That's such a weird statement.

fkni53z	The closing of supposed healing sites like Lourdes proves that there is no validity to the healing claims	I think it makes you feel superior to everybody else...	I dont think that believing Lourdes can heal (my first time hearing about that claim at all, by the way) is a requirement for Christians. In fact, there is no Christian doctrine that makes it a requirement to believe in *any* healing sites.   I do not expect God to protect me from viruses, either. In that case, you are correct that Christianity - even if true - has no practical use. But I do not think that the ultimate goal of Christianity is my own physical well-being, and I suspect that others feel the same.	None	Well, how am I supposed to dispute that?

"I believe it's going to end up passing here in the U.S. in the next number of months.”	Sounds like us millenials will finally be able to afford stuff now.	It's not just that. The dark side of this is that the economic pain will not be over come November. We're in a recession now, and it could become a depression. UBI could prevent that. Trump is saying that the economy will rebound once this thing passes, and that the fundamentals of the economy are strong. As anyone who's been listening to Yang knows, they are not. People are living paycheck to paycheck, and that paycheck has just stopped. The economy is going to have a massive demand problem if nobody has any money after the pandemic is over.  In addition, there were already multiple bubbles and overheated markets before this pandemic. They're going to start to burst.	He's smart. If the media and public figures keep talking about UBI as if its inevitable, rather than some crazy new concept, implementation will happen much more quickly. It's looking as if it could be bipartisan as well.	My own house... thank God.	0

fnyjvo7	MSNBC Completely Endorses Universal Basic Income	I know people make fun of others who say Yang plays 4D chess, but I truly believe his dropping out was a 4D chess move. He even admitted as much.   He said one of the reasons he dropped out was because UBI had become mainstream at that point, and if he stayed in all it would serve to do is tarnish his name, his run, public perception of him and most importantly, of UBI.   He realized he and his campaign were a sinking ship, and he deployed the raft and put UBI on it before he sunk to the bottom of the ocean. UBI made it out and even being embraced by our biggest enemies, and is now not even being associated with him at all, which we shouldn't care about.    Yang doesn't care about it, he said in an interview that if he could make UBI law but it meant no one would ever know who he was and he never ran for president then he would do it. It was never about him, it was about this incredible need for UBI, no matter how we got it.   So some people might be upset that our fearless leader won't be recognized or praised for how much he fought for us, but to him it's worth it and I can respect that.	I know that we should be good sports and be happy that UBI is becoming more acceptable in the social/political climate... But MSNBC did Yang dirty by black balling him and completely dismissed UBI when he was running.   The fact that they quite conveniently pick-up everything Yang's been saying with no mention and just drop a quote from the Pope rather than the GUY WHO MADE IT HIS WHOLE PLATFORM FOR AMERICA...  Aggravating. I know the comments are gonna be like "He didn't invent it blablabla" ; but really- without Yang the idea of UBI would not be as prevalent today. Giving everyone else the credit and accolades for suggesting it... *ugh*	None	We in the Gang have to stick with him at least until 2024, he has a long game in mind and I am excited to see it.	0

What’s wrong with making money? I’d like to see what his criticism of Spotify is and if it’s related to this deal. I know plenty of music artists aren’t into Spotify, especially older rock musicians who don’t get the level of downloads that mainstream artists do. That’s not the same for Rogan. He’s getting insane money, probably more than doubling his net worth while keeping complete creative control and having a person to call if he doesn’t understand something like demonetization or stikes against him. That’s better than YouTube or Apple podcast. As for his fans, it’s still free, and the only difference is the app it’s played from.	I don't think Right or Wrong come into it.     Joe went for the $$$ after criticising Spotify for literally years.  It's gross.     Been listening to him since episode 10 or 13 and I think I'm going to tap out.

But I worked in a bowling alley once, and a mechanic got killed working late one night by being slowly crushed by a pinsetter.  They figured he lost a little lung capacity with each breath until eventually he couldn't get enough oxygen.  Took several hours.	As a doc, I can say that this is not true. Sufficient force can impede adequate airflow for ventilation without completely occluding the airways necessary for speech. You can also kill someone by putting enough pressure on their chest, making it impossible for them to make a full breath. This is often how people die when they’re crushed in rubble.	It was pretty brutal.  The Manager that found him the next morning retired shortly after.  But, he should not have been there alone, he should not have been working on the machine while it had power, and there were other safety mechanisms in play he simply ignored.  I actually just started working on pinsetters again after almost 20 years.  In training my new employees I specifically tell them this story in as much detail as possible to try to make them be smart and safe.	0

In a better world, they would have arrested Chauvin IMMEDIATELY.    Like any other time they roll up to a dead body with someone kneeling on their neck...	These comments are interesting. Besides being angry at a situation and rightfully showing outrage, do people seriously believe that charges as serious as murder/manslaughter, against a cop in a high profile incident no less, is going to happen in an instant?  If the DA is competent, they are going to take time to gather evidence and make the subsequent arrest and charges as ironclad as possible. And like they just said in the video announcing the arrest and charges, this was done in less than 4 days. I understand the outrage, but comparing a soon to be complicated and emotional trial of a killer cop to an arrest of media allegedly not following orders during a riot are really not in the same ballpark. I cant even tell anymore if people are serious, regurgitating talking points for an agenda, or just being trolls.

fsxvuj9	Bangalore Viable in Sweaty Tourny Play	gibby's ult is already insane but on a pretty long cd. the only way it would be better is if it had worse damage but had a lower cooldown	The flash bangs is for a future possible character named Husaria so I don't think they would add that for Bang.  For the ULT i just can't see the pre drop the ult. I could see if the ult could possibly get use with the smoke launcher somehow and have more of a straight line aim.

fsze6jr	Every casual right now	how would that balance it? the knocked person could self res before the last person gets knocked and you then have the same exact problem. there is nothing balanced about getting an item like that from straight RNG and no merit. like you're literally given power for doing nothing but being lucky.	Casual and Comp need to be separated.  One change to gold knockdown in Comp could be that it only works as long as at least one of your team mates is still standing. I feel like it would balance it	None	My dude, all loot in this game is subject to RNG.  The main problem for comp is that an already-wiped squad was getting additional placement points while not counting as KP for the squad that wiped them due to the item. It's entirely unbalanced right now and the proposed resolution would deal with the offending scenario.	0

ft1ogzq	Apex Legends - Summer Circuit and Competitive QOL Petition	they do not listen to feedback from pros. you're ignoring the 100 things pros have asked for that still arent in the game.	I feel like a petition is not needed.   For one, the devs listen to feedback from professional players all the time and change the game based on that (it's one of the reasons they're changing the gold kd shield).  Also, considering we were hit with a pandemic that messed up a lot of things for everyone, they've done a pretty good job with the game this season -- even without access to their main office.  And players are supposed to make living wages off their salaries from the orgs that sign them, not prizepool money.  I do want to see the game improve (especially better servers) and more prize money for the players, but give it time -- things are still chaotic out there, can't have devs risking their lives just for a videogame.  Perhaps, create a petition supporting the current Black Lives Matter movement instead of this.	None	None	0

But I'll add it to ( what's now) a 5 point plan.	I like these, but Id suggest changing number three to require every cop be bonded and licensed. Just like my plumber or electrician. Fired for misconduct? License can be suspended per board review for the severity of the offense. For example, cop is speeding without lights and sirens? 6 month license suspension. Cop does something egregious? Lifetime suspension, without chance to regain the license. Tie the license requirements into federal funds, and youve created a national licensing requirement for police.   The licensing requirements can also act as a training regulatory body.	Eliminating qualified immunity is a start, but there are ~~two~~ THREE things that would really work to end police brutality.  * Make cop pension plans subject to judgements against their beneficiaries.     So when you get past any qualified immunity test that might remain, EVERY "good cops" retirement is dependent on them "self-policing" the "bad cops" BEFORE they draw a brutality lawsuit.  *  Make it a class-A felony for a cop, having probable cause to believe another cop committed a crime, to fail in their duty to arrest the suspected criminal cop.  *  Require officers to purchase insurance coverage for the risk of their misconduct/brutality.   This takes the assessment of "good cop"/"bad cop" out of the hands of the police, and in the hands of insurance actuaries.   "Bad cops" won't be able to afford the insurance to be a cop.	None	0

When they get caught, and if it can be proven that any other cop knew about this, then EVERYONE'S retirement is at risk of just disappearing into a court settlement.  "Do you feel lucky, punk?"

ftkwb45	Humility being a virtue is a ridiculous concept.	It seems to me its not about "not liking people better than us".

Those who brag to show off their superiority are just obnoxious.	Well yeah, I just think its stupid that we "like" people that aren't better than us.

I like the strategic element later in games, but youre not PH for your pitcher in the first 4 innings unless hes having an awful game. So youre stuck watching guys strikeout or sac bunt 2-3 times a game.  Id rather just see 8-man batting orders if you think the DH is too specialized.

fvideia	Shaun on how landlords can cope with the impact of coronavirus	As a property owner, every time I think about getting into rentals, I see the petulant shits on Reddit who think the landlord who owns their shitty apartment is a 1%er.  They have no understanding the overhead that comes with renting a property and think it's pure profit.  It's not; property taxes are higher on rental properties than owner-occupied properties and property tax is no joke. Throw in mortgage and HOA fees and you're already looking at a hefty overhead before having to deal with shit breaking or an empty unit. My last house I put $30k down and paid $1100/month for mortgage, taxes, and insurance. The house across the street rented for $1800.   I paid over $70,000 in repairs and upgrades in 4 years on that place. I wouldn't have made a dime renting out that place.   I just bought a condo after selling the house.  HOA, mortgage, taxes, insurance is $1300/month. There's an identical unit for rent in my building for $1425/month.  Your landlord is probably not making more than a couple of hundred dollars a month off of you, and I don't see how it's worth the headache.	Ok so as someone who wants to buy a house and may even rent it out, Im thinking of COURSE I would have at least three four months of extra rent and would never make people pay if they couldnt. I guess Im trying to rationalize being a landlord.. but buying property seems smart.	None	None	0

A sufficiently advanced species, capable of threatening us from across the lightyears in a way which they could profit from, would have to be *so* advanced that there's a very good chance they'd have moved beyond the economics of scarcity that cause us to plunder and colonise one another.  What you're scared of is a *rival* species, somewhere around our level, and those would not be capable of reaching us. What would be capable are, relatively speaking, gods, which I'd argue are more likely to treat us with curious benevolence or outright indifference.

fwe3v6b	Don't be poor!	I've used Mint since 2010. I mostly got it because I kept over drafting my bank account. My first month recorded in Mint has $42.10 in my bank account. I waited tables then. I started working as an over hire stage hand that year and made almost $11,000 that year. The year before I used to stand in temp service line at 5 am just to bust concrete for minimum wage and then busk downtown in the evening.  I worked my way up through the ranks and bought a house in 2015 making $45,000/year. I ate beans and rice for lunch nearly everyday for 4 years while paying for that house and working on it.  I just sold that house, walked away with six figures, and bought another one. At my peak income last year, I was making $89,000/year. I took a pay cut this year to $60,000 to reduce my workload and stress levels.  My net worth is over $150,000 and I had to scrimp and save to get here. I had to quit drinking alcohol. I've never owned a new car. Before 2016, I had never bought a car for more than $2000. I've never paid for cable TV. My cell phone is 4 years old. I go out to eat maybe once a week.  I watched friends drink away their paychecks. I watched friends opt to keep working at the local bike shop instead of applying themselves at a job with growth potential. I watched friends spend hundreds of dollars on television just to watch sports ball. I watched friends get a nice job and buy a new truck before even owning a house. I watched friends too poor to invest in retirement go out to eat every day. I have friends who have more credit card debt than I pay for my mortgage, but they do have an iPhone 10.  My point is, you can do it. You have to sacrifice. You have to apply yourself and work hard with a good attitude. You have to be punctual and eager to go above and beyond the minimum.  I lived in a trailer park with my single mother. She was terrible with money and took pay day loans all the time. She didn't have a bank account and kept cash in a cupboard in the kitchen. Unfortunately, her penchant for hanging out with lowlife alcoholics killed her my senior year of high school. That was possibly the best thing that happened to me in hindsight.  The remaining members of the family live in trailers and are dealing with fentanyl addiction. My cousins didn't fair much better. Perhaps cutting ties with people who can't help themselves was what I needed to elevate myself.  It can be done. Stop chalking it up to other people and outside forces and take responsibility for your life. I'm not saying it's not fair, but I'll be damned if I let others think it's not possible.  What's helped me the most is having a goal and then making a plan and accepting it when plans don't work out and changing my goals when my interests shift. I accept failure, but not defeat. I'm not saying it shouldn't be better for everyone, but I am saying many of the people I know saying it's not fair are their own problem.	Rule 1. be wealthy.  Rule 2. don't be unwealthy.	None	None	0

Not sure who was before that but they never blew up in the same way as far as I could tell but it's just cos internet.

fxbpif1	Black cop from Maryland is going viral after being pulled over by a white cop Over 100,000 views He gives us all advice that could save lives Must watch	Wolves KILL SHEEP, don't they?    Is that the point of the metaphor?   I guess we should believe them when they tell us they're murderers.	Thanks for bringing this up. There are definite race issues that need to be addressed, however its a larger problem of police culture. You see black and other minority cops participating in this culture, and it was defined perfectly by the mentality this man spoke about when he brought up wolves and sheep.  You are so right that what really unsettled this man was that he was treated like one of the sheep and guess what?*it wasnt pleasant*. Speaks volumes	He considers himself and all other cops as the wolves and ordinary citizens as sheep.  And in the video, he is unsettled because he was treated like a sheep.  More evidence policing is biased and broken but no sympathy for this guy. It’s telling they don’t consider themselves sheepdogs.	Its a quote from American Sniper, about Chris Kyle's life before and when in the service. The reference is from his father, when he was young explaining the world to him.  The quote roughly was "There are three types of people in this world, Sheep, Wolves and Sheep Dogs." Essentially what it boils down to is Sheep are regular people, the wolves hunt the sheep, and the Sheep Dogs make it their personal responsibility to protect the sheep.  As it stands the metaphor applies as follows, the sheep is society, where police are indistinguishable from wolves and sheep dogs. At least that is my interpretation of it currently.  The way it should be is law abiding citizenry, should be sheep, the police, sheep dogs, and criminals the wolves.	0

fy9jyaf	[Capitalists] What do you consider to be 'deaths from capitalism'?	Insurance being tied to employment is a holdover from WWII wage controls. They put a cap on how much people could be paid, and to try and attract talent, companies enticed them with other fringe benefits like health insurance. Now it has become status quo. The law of unintended consequences of statist policies.   One thing- take a look at LASIK. This is a procedure not covered by any state or private insurance. How has it's price and quality done over the last 25 years? It used to be $10,000 per eye and be of questionable quality. If you think capitalism has ruined healthcare, I urge you to dig a little deeper.	Hospital bills, I'm a capitalism supporter but I'm also Canadian and it rocks my shit when I hear about these medical bills even for the simplest things, I'm blown away at how the cost has run away. I get the insurance is tied to employment which is an incentive to get better employment, but what about when you're in college? Also, if Healthcare is so expensive in the US wouldn't it add incentive for people to be healthier? Why would you risk becoming obese when the potential costs for say a heart surgery will be massive? Not sure how it happened, I would expect there to be more low cost service providers in a private healthcare market, but I guess that isn't the case? I'd also love to hear from someone more knowledgeable on the subject.	None	Reminder that all the tools used in lasik are based on tax payer funded innovations. Obviously lasers being the most obvious.	0

fyjp035	Theory: Aliens aren't hiding from us, but each other	We don't have a part reptilian brain, the reptile brain was just an old term used for the parts of the brain that manage unconscious physiological functions and simple instinctual behaviours.   The theory was that more complex parts of the higher brain developed sequentially as we evolved, and the older, unconscious part resembles the simpler brains found in modern reptiles, which were considered pretty mindless creatures at the time.   Turns out it's a largely inaccurate model, and one that's a bit unfair to reptiles, and the term isn't really used anymore.	I mean they say we have a part reptilian brain, which could suggest they have altered our dna. Maybe we was once a hyper intelligent species but some of us where taken, altered and now we have been enslaved to do their bidding. I have nothing to back this up just enjoy hypothesising.	Yeah, the reptile like aliens are supposedly extremely aggressive and hyper intelligent. Most of the others from what I've read dont like them at all.  Not saying this is real just stuff I've read years ago.	Great explanation, I wish I knew more about biology to fit it into some of my thoughts more scientifically	0

Is wholesaling mutual funds possible to get into from an MBA?	Spent 4 years after college working for a boutique IB. Over worked and under paid. Made an exit and now I sell mutual funds. Work life balance is much better and I make more money.	None	I would think it’s definitely possible but you’ll probably be over qualified as an internal if you have an MBA. I work for a firm that has about 20 internals and 40 externals. Most of the internals started with a few years of prior experience but we have a few that started right out of college. Most of the externals have the CIMA and started their careers out as an internal.	0
g07hyyg	Ex Investment Bankers, why did you quit and what do you do now, how much better is it?	What kinds of backgrounds do your co-workers have? Is PWM possible to get into from an MBA program?	Sick of the hours and always having a boss. Moved to Private wealth management and also manage some corporate relationships(equity comp plans).   I like it a lot better. I make more money, I have recurring revenue, I can pretty much do what I want on any given day and I can still get paid off IB deals.	None	Co-worker background is somewhat diverse but it’s rather difficult to get into PWM without a finance background. I’d suggest going the route of traditional wealth management where there is more flexibility. You have two options with PWM/Wealth Management. You can either be an advisor, or you can try and join an advisor team that is like a fully functioning business. If you can attract new clients, you can do it all on your own and start your own team. For that, it doesn’t really matter what your background is. To join a team, you will want to have some sort of background that could benefit the team and their clients(an analyst, relationship manager, a “junior advisor,” team operations manager etc. PWM is going to be difficult to break into, wealth management won’t be as tough. Earning potential is the same in PWM or traditional wealth management.	0
g0j5izf	"A society that invests in meaningful idleness, like education and sport, would be truly revolutionary" -Max Hayward (Sheffield) on employment and the value of leisure.	Not totally backwards. Leisure and work overlap so much so as to the point of near indistinguishability. Also, they still get something like 4 or 5 weeks paid vacation (which seems crazy to me, at least)  Anecdotally, I cannot think of a country that was more difficult to deal with than when I had to deal with Greek companies in telecom sales. And I sold service contracts in legitimately war torn regions of the middle east that were easier to deal with and clients easier to get ahold of than the half dozen or so Greek based businesses I dealt with. They'd escalate issues and phone me at 2 AM EST to complain about an invoice line item expecting an immediate reply but never answer when I made it a point to call them during regular business hours in their timezone. They'd just ding me back the next day in the middle of the night again expecting a different result. Utterly frustrating. Their own government can't even get them to pay taxes. Good luck with a net 30 purchase order.	You have this backwards. [Greeks work longer hours than anyone else in Europe.

g0pupwh	Boneworks is incredible!	I think Alyx represents what a AAA game experience in VR could look like. I think Boneworks is the actual future of what we can do in VR. Yes it was janky but a lot of games of the past that experimented with new ideas were janky.   A lot of people say after they played Alyx they didn't like Boneworks anymore. But for me Alyx helped me appreciate all the things that Boneworks did. I would much rather have a game that pushes boundaries and be janky than a game that doesn't bring much of anything new to the table. I get the enjoyment of the polished experience, but I'm just not in that camp.	How does it compare to Alyx?	People really don't appreciate how advanced the physical interaction systems are in Boneworks. There are definitely some games that do certain things better than it, but none have tied everything together the way BW has done.   People who dislike it jump into it, realize the interaction is different from other VR games they've played, and immediately refund it without giving it a chance. Really a shame since it's probably the only game right now that truly pushes the boundaries of VR.	I played boneworks first and sepecially with all the half life references it was very motivating and uplifting (apart from awesome things it let you do) to look forward what alyx gonna be, then alyx came out and you couldnt even use props as melee.   If anything boneworks got me really disappointed in alyx gameplay, not the other way.	0

g19csiw	CMV: Voting in either of the two major political parties in the U.S. does not automatically make you a bad person.	All my points are still valid in the U.S. If I for example would say "every member of the Republicans is evil" - logically it does not follow that I somehow say all other cultures are terrible.	This was meant for the 2 party system in the U.S. I was not writing about hypotheticals or other countries' systems.	That depends on your own morals. Since you brought up abortion:  If I would view abortion as literally killing children than yes everybody that voted for a party that supports abortion I view as a bad person. Because that single issue alone would probably make every other thing irrelevant.  >Arguing that members of one party are fundamentally evil is the same thing as saying that all cultures that are not your own, are terrible.  No that does not follow. If I say that member of the Nazi party are evil it does not follow that every other culture is wrong.	None	0

g47661q	The truth about free will – Why choice is not an illusion.	if free will exists and the universe is not wholly deterministic that  opens up a whole realm of possibility and affords choice.  Elsewise we can't make value judgements on any action. Good choice, bad choice. Who's to say? There's no morality. It basically all already happened. The argument for determinism presupposes this conversation and all actions before or after.	How does indeterminism make it any better though? Doesnt make a difference; the minute you can deconstruct the self in terms of a physically divisible brain then you're essentially explaining away the self and all forms of free will regardless of what type of universe you live in.	What’s even the point of philosophy if your contention is that we live in a wholly deterministic universe? It’s like in your dozen or more years of life you decided you’re married to this reality and now not just you but everybody else is simply going through the motions and passing the time as it goes by	A not-wholly-deterministic is just one that is more random. That doesnt help because choices and value judgements cannot be random.  A true free will can only work if it is free from both deterministic and random influences which makes no sense. The concept is incoherent.	0

g4h44t2	An idea on section 8 / subsidized housing	I think a big part of it is giving them the freedom to use it how they see fit. If they got some classes on how to responsibly own real estate, and we trust them to act like adults, I don't think it would be a problem. Would some people let themselves get swindled? Yea but that happens to people every day. Part of the reward of owning real estate is that there is some risk involved. You can't eliminate the downside and take advantage of the upside. It has to be totally owned free and clear with no state meddling in the market.	Letting them sell it seems like a disaster. Now you are basically giving them free money, that you could've got by selling the house yourself. People *will* take your offer and then hoard these houses. You have to construct one house per person, every person, and they will not go to the people who need them, but to the people who know how to make money flipping real estate.

g5pez2n	Spotify against transphobic Joe Rogan	Agreed. That’s the easy example though. What are your thoughts on Caster Semenya? She was born intersex female, and while we don’t know her exact disorder of sex development (DSD), the most common DSD in women is 46 XY DSD, where the presence of a Y chromosome causes the development of testes. These do not descend from the abdomen but do produce testosterone. However the receptors for testosterone are abnormal, with the result that the individual develops as female with a vagina, but no ovaries or uterus.  Does she compete against females or males?	Joe isn't transphobic, he just doesn't think it's fair for men to transition to women and compete in sports against biologically born females.....no hate involved, Joe wants everyone to be happy and be their best selves regardless of who you are or what you want to be....just a fair playing field in sports....

Neurodiversity is understanding that being different isn't a disease, that being different by itself isn't a bad thing.  It does *not* require you to accept immoral actions as a good thing.	Why do you quote me out of context and refuse to link to the actual post?  You ignored the other post after where i explained the issues with reducing females to property.   Regarding pedophilia: you need to promote pedophilia acceptance too if you are going to be consistent with your neurodiversity nonsense. With pedophilis i mean people mostly attracted to children younger than 13.	None	> It does not require you to accept immoral actions as a good thing.  Being attracted primarily to children under 13 is not an action, it's a problematic sexual orientation.	0

I'm pretty sure you won't get either of these things.	I'm hoping for 2 things. 1) A ban announcement that's comprehensive and wide reaching. Threats that are also snowballing value engines, sources of explosive free mana, free spells, it need to go for a healthy meta to develop. If not, the hive mind will identify the next best broken thing and perfect it immediately.  2) A companion article outlining all the mistakes they've learned from 2019 onward, how the F.I.R.E. philosophy is unsustainable for the long term health of the game, and a clear roadmap of actions they're going to undertake to fix design from degenerating going forward.

g6xli04	The 2020 Houston Astros officially finish the season with a losing record	Dodgers and Yankees didn't mind signing "cheaters" to fat contracts. I bet they'll be fine.	The best thing that can happen to them at this point is that they get crushed in the playoffs, with the big guys going 0-35. Then next year, Altuve, Bregman, Correa, Springer all have shitty seasons again and everyone believes they were only good cause they cheated and they get 0 payday in FA.	I don’t care what record they finished with.  They should not be in this postseason. They cheated.  Recently. It was proven that they cheated. They were given no real consequence to it.  What’s to stop them from doing it again with some other method.    Another non cheating team deserves the honor of playing playoff Baseball. This is why I will never be ok with it.

She's too busy suing the pilot's mourning family for his measly estate	Yeah, she doesn't need to come out and make a statement about it either.

Butler has bam and dragic, hes not gonna take as many shots and run as many plays as he is with them off the field. Does that suddenly mean he's doing less for his team / less skilled?	People who think KD was ever better than Lebron are smoking that good stuff.

g86iji4	The most frightening part of the VP Debate	Fun fact. There is no such thing as a “popular vote” in the US.	Fun fact: the popular vote was in Hillarys favor, so your the will of the people statement is scientifically more bullshit than truth.	I agree. The 3.5 years democrats spent trying to usurp the will of the people via a collusion hoax was pretty scary. Literally treason.   Now you want to stack the courts which would effectively eliminate the separation of powers in our country, the bedrock of our republic. You people are tyrants. End of story.	The popular vote (of each state, and depending on all-or-nothing or split-vote laws) determines the electoral college vote. It exists.  Another fun fact: the electoral college was created as a safeguard against outspoken populist groups that would corrupt the popular vote, so that electors could choose not to follow the votes of their constituents if the candidate was clearly inept. They had their chance to prove that they were worth being employed, and now a wrinkly orange turd has plummeted us into a disease-ridden recession.	0

The Big Five tech companies constitute 20% of the entire value of the stock market. They have taken over 730 companies over the last 5ish years.   It is totally legal. Reluctance to enforcement since the 90s is the rise of international competitors (Tencent, Alibaba) who are not subject to American antitrust laws and serve to benefit most from big tech breakup.   International cooperation was sought in the 90s but is futile.   The only reason all of these companies havent been broken up is they claim international competitors will swoop in.	I’m not really informed but is this legal? I’m a bit libertarian and I wouldn’t fancy it if the government decided my company was bad and broke it up	Many of those "companies" were just ideas that kept their burn slightly behind their funding just long enough to be noticed by one of the FANG.

g90bpek	Just finished HALF LIFE ALYX...........	Gonna have to disagree with ya on Boneworks. While the game has jank it is probably one of the most innovative VR games on the market and I think it represents more about what can be possible with future VR games than Alyx does. Alyx actually played it really safe with it's gameplay. Boneworks did not and while that leads to more jank, it also leads to more new unexplored ideas. There were some puzzles in the game that made me think about video games puzzles in ways I've never come across before. And maybe I'm in the minority but I think I like new ideas that are not as polished more than old ideas that are perfectly polished.  I think the hate Boneworks gets totally ignores the accomplishments the game made, and I personally think it's close minded but that's just my two cents.	Gonna disagree on boneworks. That game makes your brain feel like it's bleeding, it feels like you're mostly fighting the game engine and yourself.	not much that can hold a candle to HL:A to be honest. 2 other really good ones are boneworks and the walking dead saints and sinners.	I definitely appreciate what they were trying do do with boneworks but the result for me was just thoroughly unpleasant.

gamzg6d	How we feeling about DGB these days?	Well, if we'd talk strictly about the fundamentals, DGB should be at 1000th of a Bitcoin. That would be 13 dollars, right now. Of course, Bitcoin has a first mover advantage and much better known, but purely fundamentally speaking, DGB is superior (for the reasons I talked about in my other comment).   In truth, you could imagine a ten times less market cap for DGB would be "fair", meaning a 1.3$ right now. But with Bitcoin going to over $100k, it wouldn't be out of the realm of reality to have DGB at the 2-10 dollar range. It just needs use cases and to be \*\*used\*\* - to have useful applications, not just trading on an exchange and doing nothing else with it (this is of course true for every crypto, that's why using Bitcoin, for one, to buy real-life things is absolutely \*\*essential\*\* for the adoption of cryptocurrencies).

gbgghlh	Unjerk Thread of November 07, 2020	There's enough evidence outside of exit polls to tell us about both of those though. Trump has been favored by white women for a while and in counties like Miami-Dade, where there's a big Latino population, Trump has overperformed.  Also getting more of the Latino/women vote should be a priority of Democrats anyways. It would be pretty poggers to not have a Democrat campaign outright admitting "Latinos are not part of our path to victory"	From the rooftops:     PUNDITS STOP WRITING ARTICLES AND TWITTER THREADS BASED ON EXIT POLLS. EXIT POLLS HEAVILY FAVOR IN PERSON VOTING SO THEY HEAVILY FAVOR TRUMP. DON'T SAY SHIT LIKE TRUMP'S SUPPORT WITH LATINOS AND WOMEN IS HIGHER WHEN WE DON'T KNOW THAT ALL WE HAVE IS EXIT POLLS WITH SELECTION BIAS.	None	His polling before the election was actually really poor with white women, and some of the Miami-Dade stuff is true.

She was for sure riding on the "vote blue no matter who" people to get her elected because she knew anybody who actually researched her would be like bleh.

gcgea56	Are drug cartels and other organized crime examples of Anarcho-Capitalism or Libertarianism?	Well the prices would plummet because there wouldn't be the risk of jail/death to produce and sell and buy this stuff. Then it would be just like any aspirin or cigarettes or whiskey.	I agree, the state should not have the authority to decide what you can and can't put in your body, or even what substances you're allowed to possess.      What do you think would happen in the absence of the state's laws against those substances? Would the market for them allow drug cartels to grow and fill that power vacuum, effectively becoming a new state, or would the lack of prohibition eliminate demand in their markets and diminish their power?	An example of why making laws against victimless crimes is a stupid waste of resources. I'd say libertarian. It's a good example of what the war on drugs has wrought. Whom do you trust to tell you what you should and shouldn't put in your body? Who has the audacity to presume to tell you? Booze it up? No problem. Do some fancy substance at a phish concert, straight to jail.	Effectively cutting off a huge source of funding for cartels and organized crime. Interesting.	0

gdi1tzu	#1569 - John Mackey - The Joe Rogan Experience	Genuinely curious how a curfew is scientifically proven to stop the spread? I take the virus seriously, but idk if these muppet governors are making sound science base policy taking into consideration all the costs or if they are doing everything to signal to their base and ride a media hype.	Honestly, Joe's view on masks, curfews and social distancing are such BS. Science has shown these are the way to stop a virus from spreading and thus save lives.  Here in Melbourne Australia, we wore masks, socially distanced and had curfew for a few months and now we have 0 cases. 0 cases - It works.   For some reason Joe has turned it completely into a political/freedom conversation, which from a non-american just looks ridiculous because the facts about it are right there for him to read.  There is a conversation to be had around whether lockdowns are worth saving the lives for, but this is never mentioned. It's only ever to do with 1. They don't work or 2. Reducing my freedom.  I'm tired of it. I'm tired of Joe and after 10 years of being a massive fan, i'm slowly moving away.	None	I had the same query. We had a 8pm curfew. It helps because it reduces movement (so reduces potential to spread the virus).   Generally speaking it's not essential for people to be out and about after 8pm (all shopping, exercise, etc can be done before then), so it was an easy way to help reduce spread.  Obviously people working night shift or strange hours were exempt from it.	0

If you read the image in the linked tweet, they're moving to permanently revoke their licenses	Curious to know how long the suspension is.  Going to be a pretty hefty penalty I'd think.  Narcotics, assault, and obstruction. oof	> The Registrar also issued Notices of Proposal (NOP) to revoke the establishments’ liquor licences for an infraction of the Liquor Licence Act (LLA) , including the requirement that the licence holder act and carry on business in accordance with the law and with honesty and integrity.

They've always been useless. Letting a single person tell you what's good and entertaining is whack. The only ratings that I'd say are sorta valuable would be Cagematch's due to the group voting but even then you're very clearly seeing a particular subset of fan's opinions   One big sucky thing about wrestling being pretty niche is that you're less likely to find someone you know irl that can recommend stuff as opposed to you going up to your buddy who likes horror movies, rap music, etc. and asking their thoughts on a particular work	Meltzer ratings are mostly useless at this point. What is the actual point of having a review segment that just focuses on the already most popular, established products made by the companies that have the biggest advertising budgets. Most people who regularly shows watch it would watch it regardless and most of the people on the fence would probably be swayed by hype.

I see so often as an argument for removing these regulations that "the free market will self-regulate", making all the objectively terrible practices, that in many cases literally killed people, unviable (eventually). I've never understood why, if a behavior will be made obsolete by the free market, that the behavior being also illegal is a problem.  Example: "we should make it legal to dump toxic waste in public water, because the free market will stop people from dumping toxic waste in public water", doesn't actually make very much sense to me. Logically, the end result is that there is as much toxic waste in the water as is profitable, and that amount is greater than the current amount because more legal is more profitable. And never underestimate the ability of corporations to convince large numbers of people that up is down; cigarettes and leaded gasoline being prime examples.

It can be easy to say "I eat less than my friends!" When you've made a lifestyle out of eating a little less than them, but doing a LOT less than them. Activity levels over a lifetime account for a lot.	That was my cycle too. Still is some days, even though I am trying really hard to break it. I would eat very small meals for breakfast (a small microwaveable egg sandwich that had 240 calories according to the lable) and then a salad with a packet of tuna (between 70 to 90 calories depending on the flavor) with no dressing for lunch. By the time I got home from work I was super hungry, and I would tell myself "I've only really eaten like 400 calories today, so I can have basically whatever I want for dinner."   It took a long time for me to accept the fact that eating a huge, several thousand calorie meal every night was going to make me gain weight, even if I legitimately ate barely anything all day.	0

gh3zlhc	“Fabric” is a construct made by the racist patriarchy to dehumanize women	Exactly. Plus there is more wear and tear on stress points - crotch seams, under the arms, etc. So bigger clothing needs to be reinforced as well.	It's also hard because people's fat distributes differently. Some people are apples, some are pears. People complain that plus-sized clothes are shapeless but if you do too much shaping it actually makes them harder to sell. With straight sizes, you can just sort of follow the skeleton more.	Dresses for fat people aren’t just scaled up version of dresses for thin people. The steps are actually different and more cumbersome.	I used to go through jeans every 6 months, the fabric work just wear away in the inner thighs, but now I've had my favorite pair for over three years and the only change is they're very faded black instead of dark black.	0

gh49l9h	Imagine being this delusional	Yoga is a very broad category of different kinds fo exercise. Intense ashtanga or vinyasa, in my experience, can rival the kind of gymnastic workouts that professional athletes do. Yin yoga, on the other hand, has a similar caloric burn to sitting on the couch and stretching a little. I personally love both but I wouldn't want to make any guesses as to how fit someone was simply cos they did yoga a lot.	I notice many in the FA crowd talk about Yoga alot, and yoga is great, but I've recently taken it up with my wife and she started me out super slowly and we did like 45 minutes of low intensity basic yoga, it wasn't a workout, it was just a longer version of my typical pre workout stretching.  None of this is bad by any means, I just think that low intensity yoga, not done in proper form (because I've oft seen them complain about having trouble finding yoga teachers who teach forms for "larger bodies") doesn't really count as any kind of meaningful workout or healthy activity.  Also if there are any experienced practitioners of yoga out there who would like to correct me please feel free.	None	That's the thing about yoga - any person can say they do yoga.  There are practices you can do while totally fat and out of shape.  It's better than nothing, but it's not the yoga people are doing who are incredibly fit just from yoga.  Here is the best part though: yoga is "non-judgmental" so you can never call someone out on lying about doing yoga like you can with other forms of exercise or sports.  It's the perfect "cop out" exercise.	0
gh49zhe	Imagine being this delusional	Yoga, pilates and body weight workouts generally can be surprisingly intense. You don't need a lot of equipment to get your ass kicked, if you're doing it properly. But I am certain this is not the kind of yoga that FAs do.	I went to my local Core Power studio a lot before COVID, and I will agree that while their level 1 class was challenging at times, it's definitely not on par with the workouts I was doing elsewhere. I will say that the level 2 classes did feel like exercise, maybe a step under barre. And the Yoga Sculpt classes were definitely workouts, they had a fair amount of cardio and strength training.  I think yoga has some health benefits, and doing it is better than not doing anything, but I wouldn't call someone "active" if all they did was standard yoga.	I notice many in the FA crowd talk about Yoga alot, and yoga is great, but I've recently taken it up with my wife and she started me out super slowly and we did like 45 minutes of low intensity basic yoga, it wasn't a workout, it was just a longer version of my typical pre workout stretching.

I just don't like to see yoga get a bad rap around here.	0
gh4imhd	Ah, Tess.	She disguises it well on Instagram but she's not very mobile. There's a video of her trying to get up from a bended knee, she had to kneel down for a group photo shoot, and she couldn't do it. She has to have several people haul her up.  I also saw her walking at that fashion week catwalk event she did, and she seemed like she was genuinely struggling just to make it a few hundred metres in relatively flat shoes.	Tess, gurl. You couldnt do half of what a normal person does in a day. Your exercise literally involves walking up like 3 flights of stairs. That aint a workout hun, thats just a normal persons day to day. Shes got to be close to 500lbs by now. Keep it up babe and you might actually reach 1000.	None	The video of her struggling to get up is years old now too. She’s gained weight since then. It’s hard to know how large she is considering she shops all of her photos to hell and back.	0
gh5vjqw	does this scream “female incel” to anyone else?	Also it's pretty narcissistic to assume the only reason someone isn't into you is because they're shallow. Maybe the fat people also have a shit personality, based on this article title I'm going to assume that's closer to being true.	what upsets me is that providing emotional support does not mean that person owes you anything romantic or sexual.	Okay here's the thing: I think all of us have an experience, usually when we were young, when we think we're helping a friend who's down on their luck. And then the other shoe drops and you see that they're a narcissist, they were using you. There's a way to handle that. You write it down in your diary. You don't need to broadcast your hurt to the world. Especially not in such an anvilly way with no nuance. Like this doesn't help anyone, not even her. It just exposes her vulnerability.	None	0

Yea I know.  What happens is the water molecules - H2O are each split into two hydrogen (H) and one oxygen (O) molecule.   So the only byproducts are hydrogen and oxygen.     Any water molecules that weren’t split apart remain water (H2O).	0
ghofuq6	Socialism: what would/does "worker ownership of means of production" look like in practice?	The problem with "the benefit of society" is that if you ask 100 people what that means you'll get 500 answers.	Worker ownership of the MOP would look different depending on the industry. But the basic idea is that now you have a voice and vote when it comes to decisions, as opposed to not knowing anything until you get an email that your job is being sent to China. This could be as simple as voting for management positions, or having a board made up of elected team leaders who make decisions. There's many ways to implement democracy in the workplace.   However, if the goal of these companies is the exchange of products and services for profit, then it is basically just a bunch of Coops in a capitalist society. In a Socialist society, production is done for the "benefit of society" not profit. This could look different depending on where and how it is implemented. But the general idea is cooperation and organization.   Different versions of Socialism have different solutions. And one could debate about which solution would solve which problems given each situation.	None	We don't have to have one clear answer. We can start with better and worse. It is better for people in society to have food and water, than to not have food and water. Just because we don't know everything doesn't mean we give up, and it doesn't mean that we don't have some answers already.	0
ghttx4l	I find it amazing how the "party of personal freedom" also loves taking it away when they don't agree with it	The Republican party still lists banning gay marriage as a priority in [their platform](https://www.gop.com/platform/renewing-american-values/):  &gt;Our laws and our government’s regulations should recognize marriage as the union of one man and one woman and actively promote married family life as the basis of a stable and prosperous society. For that reason, as explained elsewhere in this platform, we do not accept the Supreme Court’s redefinition of marriage and we urge its reversal, whether through judicial reconsideration or a constitutional amendment returning control over marriage to the states.  I don't think it's a closed issue until they stop with that nonsense, though I agree that they have little to no chance of making that happen; popular opinion is against them and religious arguments don't go very far in the courts, or even in general these days. There's still the peripheral questions of "should it be legal to discriminate against gay people in housing and employment?", and "how can we stop them from adopting or obtaining parental rights?", which were only very recently addressed by the courts and still could be reversed.	This is reddit, so it's probably 70% liberal fist rattling.  Gay marriage is effectively a closed issue. The remaining issues are:  - abortion ( the big one) - transexual questions - Obamacare and contraception - school and homeschool choice - religion and schools - animal rights	With the exception of gay marriage, I don't see something they were arguing legally. Flag burning, pledge standing, and peaceful protest were seen as socially unacceptable but legal. Peaceful protest was even supported, even by the people who heavily criticized the rioting.	None	0
ghtuwxt	Why are so many self described libertarians actually closeted nationalists, alt right, conservatives, etc?	&gt;white men are the scourge of humanity and have all of the privilege in the world and have no struggles of their own  I have lived in several very left areas for my entire life, and I have only ever heard this or anything remotely approaching it from conservatives saying that everyone around them says it. There's probably a handful of people saying it on Twitter... that's a far cry from constantly hearing it as you grow up, and I'm fairly certain that this is fiction.	I'll tell you why they like white supremacy, imagine growing up in a trailer park dirt poor constantly hearing how white men are the scourge of humanity and have all of the privilege in the world and have no struggles of their own. Stuff like that is why suddenly when they run into a group who doesn't place them as evil and corrupt for being born they listen and believe in whatever they say. I hate the fact that in modern America we are actively creating racists because of all of the attention on trying to eliminate it.	My honest theory is that a large chunk of the people you meet online are going to be teenage boys (or adult men with maturity of one) regardless of the community. They are attracted to the title of "libertarian" because in many ways it signifies rebellion.   They also latch onto the beliefs of the aforementioned groups (idk why teenage boys these days like white supremacy tbh) so you get a large group of "libertarians" in these shitty groups.	Also, white nationalism existed long before the term "white privilege" so it's a BS argument.	0

ghu975w	"Being true to yourself is a lonely path, but it is better than the alternative," says terf, completely failing to see the irony.	I get that but it's just so blatantly absurd to characterize being trans as this highly effective social contagion that spreads like wildfire and turns everyone trans on contact. How could you not immediately react with "that's ridiculous" without yourself being entirely gone to delusional thinking.	It fits in with their narrative, which is that transmen are the victim of a social infection that spreads through friend groups.	Theres of course some small chance that this terf isnt lying but how realistic is it that out of a group of 4,  30 something years old adults, 3 of them would all start transitioning and be friends with a terf still.   Does this not come across as fake to other terfs even?  They talk like they live in some hell world where literally anyone could be the next victim of the Trans Cult^tm^^cr  And also like 60% of people are trans now.	Sure, but they've created a scenario where all that ridiculousness gets placed on the concept of trans people existing. So, the more ridiculous it is, the more it reinforces their beliefs.	0

gi86ecz	I’m in the YM leadership and I want to make sure they all know they’re witnessing a coup attempt by traitors to this country	Then describe it in the way you just described it, but leave the incendiary and hyperbolic language like "coup attempt" out of it. That isn't what it is. It is the desperate flailings of a narcissistic, failed candidate. Nothing more.	I don't think Trump has to succeed to do lasting damage. And what that lasting damage is concerns me way more than the idea he somehow remains as president. There's a whole section of America who no longer believe anything that disagrees with what Trump tells them. I don't think most people have looked into the accusations of fraud that Trump is making (like millions and millions of illegal votes, voting machines changing results, etc). Being concerned about states changing laws is one thing. But most of Trump's accusations aren't along those lines. And people are eating those accusations up. We won't be done with Trump or Trumpism on January 20. It's going to be around for a looong time.	There is no Constitutional or legal means by which Trump, Congress, or anyone can prevent Biden from being inaugurated and taking office. You claiming it is a coup attempt is alarmism and isn't appropriate to be teaching to your YM.   I think it would be fine to sit down and do a civics lesson, something akin to Citizenship in the Nation merit badge, where you walk through what the Constitution actually says about the shenanigans going on and how they are doomed to failure, but leave the hyperbolic language out of it.	Correct me if I’m wrong but the only thing preventing Trump from succeeding is the fact he doesn’t have enough votes in the House and Senate willing to go along. I’d agree it’s narcissistic flailing but I don’t see it as harmless. And under different circumstances it would actually succeed in denying a duly elected president the White House.	0

There should be a release notes article that will state this, like for modern horizons.	Not really. There isn’t a high enough chance that you’ll play them, and that they’ll draw that card in a game vs them, that it’s worth wasting your own picks on hate if there are playable cards in the pack.

Some people's olfactory senses can't detect the asparagus pee smell.  I don't think I've ever smelled asparagus pee, but I don't know which of these two types I am. 	"Asparagus will make my pee smell funny"--emotion AND science.  But seriously, I wish more people would make decisions based upon science--or at least rationality--rather than emotion.	I think that's based more on how much you've eaten, what else you've eaten, how hydrated you are etc. I've had it happen a few times, but usually don't get it even after eating a whole jars of pickled beetroot.

giwxywr	Favorite main story mission/arc in Witcher 3: Wild Hunt	I think it's mostly due to Avallac'h.  Personally, I like him as a Side Character - And to have such a Mission is also a great idea.

We never really get to know what's up wie Avallac'h, yeah he shows us the White Frost but obviously Ciri also know about it so she could have explained it to us the same more or less. So we're stuck with a Dude which obviously doesn't tell us everything and we all kinda don't really want to go with. Especially the whole "Yeah we've to talk to Person X because ... of reasons.".  Storywise, there wouldn't be a way possible to send reinforcments anyway or did I miss something? Because the "Golden Child" was already with the Wild Hunt - Otherwise they couldn't have come anyway and after Geralt punched him, he couldn't go back to take more Elves with him to Skellige - so ... ?  But that's critic which is really picky overall.	bloody baron was definitely amazing, as well as searching for the sorceresses and going to the Vegelbuds with Triss.

(For maximum edginess).	None	Doubtful. But they sure don’t have to be. Lol.	0
giyjmdj	417 speed limit	oh ya! and when you merge approaching highway speeds and there's a slow driver going 70 in the right lane they just refuse to move over or accelerate to let you in safely.  Just casually run you into the median when the ramp ends  It's baffling.	Woah, hold up. People accerlate to 70 for you? I get caught behind people wanting to merge at 60.   I have lived and driven all over Canada. I have never seen it as bad as Ottawa drivers for merging so slowly onto a highway.	Surprised you could get even close to that. I always get stuck behind people who can't merge properly and then I'm going 70 and can't pass without getting rear ended	None	0

gj2yu5m	A Majority of Mormons Embraced Trumpism. Now What?	I have liked Trump's SC picks. Gorsuch and Coney-Barrett in particular are going to be great.  I am impressed with the peace accords in the Middle East (assuming they last and aren't purely contingent on the flow of weapons). Even getting them to sit down at the table together was impressive.  I like how tough he has been on China and Iran (if only he would have been that tough on Russia and NK).  Pretty much everything else he has done has turned to crap, often disastrously so.  I couldn't come anywhere near saying I "approve of the job Trump is doing", but also haven't disagreed with everything he has done. How would they have classified me in their survey?	You are correct. [However](https://utahpolicy.com/index.php/features/today-at-utah-policy/24105-analysis-trump-support-in-utah-lagging-among-moderate-republicans-and-faithful-members-of-the-lds-church),   >Across the nation, active Mormons are some of the presidents most loyal supporters among the various religious groups.  >But in Utah, Y2 finds that half of all very active LDS women disapprove of Trump. And a very high 41 percent strongly disapprove of the president.  >Compare that with only 34 percent of very active LDS men disapproving of Trump, and only 27 percent strongly disapproving of the president.  >Half of all active Mormon women approve of the president, but 65 percent of active LDS men approve of the job Trump is doing as president, Y2 finds -- a much higher approval rating.	OP title and article title is a lie. Especially considering that >50% of members on the rolls are outside the US, and the claim that only 30% of members on the rolls are active, this claim is specious and dubious.  I can count on 1 hand the number of Trump proponents in my current ward.  I can count on my other the number of social media contacts I have who are mormon and Trump proponents.	I hope the sedition that came with it was worth it to you.   As to your final question. 🤷‍♂️	0
gj43mt7	A Majority of Mormons Embraced Trumpism. Now What?	Neither was op title or article title.	>I can count on my other the number of social media contacts I have who are mormon and Trump proponents.  Not exactly scientific.	OP title and article title is a lie. Especially considering that >50% of members on the rolls are outside the US, and the claim that only 30% of members on the rolls are active, this claim is specious and dubious.  I can count on 1 hand the number of Trump proponents in my current ward.  I can count on my other the number of social media contacts I have who are mormon and Trump proponents.

Let's be honest, Dustin threw Tony under the bus aswell though when Conor came calling	Dustin and Tony didn't turn him down to be picky though. It was a contract issue, they both wanted more money. Tony, in typical Tony fashion, still ended up taking a fight for the same money though.	Top 5 fighters shouldn’t be allowed to turn down fights for any reason but injury.

gjpih5r	An article from Buzzfeed "News" about 1200 calorie diets, full of starvation mode and bull	Your body is pretty adaptible and can recover from most things you do to it, with enough time.   But you are correct. If you want to lose weight sustainably and keep it off, without losing your mental health in the mean time or triggering yourself to massively binge, not going below your BMR is a much more effective means of losing weight.	A question just for understanding - you shouldn't go lower than your BMR while dieting, right? Like, if you have a BMR of 1450 the 1200 isn't for you?   Sorry, I'm just very confused sometimes with numbers.	None	> without losing your mental health in the mean time or triggering yourself to massively binge  So aside from those issues it's okay?

Start looking for a new job that actually embraces positive change and a better work-life balance. We need to show employers that the old way of doing things is more harmful than beneficial.  Admittedly, I'm a huge environmentalist and love to see fewer cars on the road / reduced usage of physical office space / etc. but it **just makes sense**.	None	My god yes. A million times this.  I was there too, filling out a ton of applications every day - from the time I woke up until the time I went to sleep, right after grad school. Eventually ended up getting a job as a counselor in a halfway house, at a really pathetic pay rate. Still, it was a starting point.

Im not having a go and I am definitely on your sided here, but the fact you wont quit or maybe cant quit is the reason they are doing this. Its been getting worse for years, companies are profiting more and passing nothing on to their employees in the way of pay rises.

Had indoor parking and people still broke into my car, because the gate didn't work. That being said I think you can get cheeper insurance if you have garage parking over street.	We got a badass place with little ghetto activity. You really need to watch out for that. Across the bridge to the south is Baghdad, and north of Shockoe has had some light skirmishes.  Downtown you have normal muggings, but if you're out at 3 AM without a gun, I dont know what to tell you.   Around campus is okay. For some reason that damn block the Wal-mart is on has a crazy crime rate. Its cursed or something.   Utilities included is good. Indoor parking is better, because people WILL break into your car to take your shit.   I like living higher up so I don't have people stomping around above me.

If you are in a position to share, I'm very interested in your research and how my video has helped you.	Thanks for sharing, this was immensely helpful for my research!	You can't afford it yet but you will get to Egypt one day and it will be absolutely worth it.  As for the entrance, yeah it was hard for me to tell what part was original and what part was damaged by people like Caliph al Ma’mun.  I believe the existing research shows that the pyramid was built on top of a naturally formed rock hill with tunnelsystems that were there long before and leads to a massive underground lake. For 2000$ they'll take you to a nearby entrance called the tomb of Osiris where you can swim in that same lake.  It's on my bucketlist :P  Good look with your research!	0

I love the way some people’s minds work	This reply typed on an iPhone 6 that will be 5 in February. No problems at all of any kind. Battery still holds a charge all day.	Apple obviously	I’m going to play devil’s advocate here- keep in mind that I wouldn’t even touch an Apple product if it wasn’t for work until a few years ago, but I’ve been thoroughly impressed with what I’ve seen of them as I’ve worked on more and more of them.   If your hardware is past a certain age, it probably won’t run the latest OS well. When you have reached that point, you probably should be looking at upgrading. Not running an actively supported Operating System is a security risk. Now I don’t know about you but even on my phone I have a lot of personal information. Do I want something that isn’t secure that contains said personal information? Fuck no. Technology is not BIFL, it is always evolving and always changing, and it’s not something like a set of nice knives or a pan you tale care of and get to use till you die and then pass down to your kids. Data demands grow, security demands grow, etc, and I certainly wouldn’t want to be running a computer I had 20 years ago, let alone a phone with how they are used nowadays for so much personal information. Getting 3-5 years out of a phone or computer is great but you shouldn’t expect anything past that. Less than that and it’s a shitty product.  I will concede, Apple definitely seems slow on picking up the latest tech. It makes 0 sense that the iPhone 11 wouldn’t have had 5g available when the technology is there, and I suspect it’s a money grab move to release something variation of the 11 next year that includes 5G as an added “feature” and not much else.	0

Hello!  Fellow CDA patient here as well!  Thanks so much for the price list, any chance you can share in spreadsheet form?  I’m currently prescribed the Bedrocan 22% and the Bedica. I’m finding the Bedrocan a little too strong and so keen to try a lower strength Sativa. The Bedica Indica is great!  Really mellow and just what I need to get to sleep when in pain.

fl3mhau	[film/tv] From the screenwriter of Aquaman 2. Any recommendations?	When you say "hurt their character for no reason"...you mean actually telling dramatic stories with a sense of genuine drama and stakes?	Balls aside, I'd rather they didn't tbh. Comics went through a big phase of just hurting their characters for no real reason. Aquadad is far more interesting a story than vengeful angry Aquaman	The question is this... do the DC film executives have the balls to kill a baby on screen? For something that their going to try and make PG-13.	Characters don't have to be hurt or experience loss to tell a good story	0
fl3mzxd	I've seen a lot of people extremely hostile towards the possibility of Brie Larson playing Ahsoka. Why is that?	\*sigh\*  This the problem, right here.  Because of the stupid controversy over her comments and the culture war battling it out over her, you can't actually criticize her as an actress in good faith without people automatically assuming you're so sexist fragile white male afraid of women.   Yes, there is no denying whatsoever that a lot of the hate Larson gets online is from flat out knuckle-dragging sexists who see evil SJW conspiracies around every corner.   BUUUUUTTTTT! I think people should be allowed to offer their honest opinions on her performances without being condemned as a sexist.   I, for one, DO think she was bland and miscast as Captain Marvel. She's simply not believable or compelling in the role. In my own personal opinion, long before she was even cast in the MCU, I was never all that impressed with her performances and found her over-hyped.   I just don't think she's that good an actor - just like other people don't think other popular actors are that good. It's a purely subjective taste thing.	Around the time Captain Marvel trailers were coming out, she made a couple of extremely tepid comments about the white maleness of mainstream criticism, then the alt-right hellscape of Reddit, whipped up into a frenzy by the Youtube algorithm, blew them way out of proportion to get to SJW white male genocide that would ruin the MCU or whatever. This was all way before the film itself came out, to be clear. It was very much about her comments, and possibly the perceived intrusion of a female lead into their franchise. Anyone who tells you the hate towards Larson is about how Captain Marvel was boring is engaging in some serious revisionism.  The reason you're seeing it about Ahsoka is that it's the same reactionary Youtubers who peddle the Fandom Menace stuff, so there's going to be a lot of overlap.  [Jack Saint did a big overview of it if you want the whole thing in detail.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztPr_97nNdw)	None	>you can't actually criticize her as an actress in good faith without people automatically assuming you're so sexist fragile white male afraid of women.  I dunno, I reckon it's pretty easy. If you need to comment at all, say something short and to the point, and move on. Don't freak out, don't act like it's the worst thing in the world (because after all, actors you don't think are that good probably get cast in stuff all the time) and don't feel the need to comment over and over.  And if you're still worried about ambiguity, you can erase it completely by throwing in something like, "At least this'll upset the neckbeards, though."  Edit: holy shit, did you just edit a load more whining in to to defend yourself against an imagined accusation of sexism from me? And you were doing *so well.*	0

Thats what I did, I tried copying it again as well when it didn't work the 3rd time i rebooted.  I copied the bin file to my downloads from my microSD (I downloaded it on my windows boot and saved it there). I've looked up a lot about it and I admit im fairly new to linux, do I need to have a wired internet connection on the Ubuntu boot in order for this fix to work? I assumed since it was just a file I could download it and transfer it to my Ubuntu drive and it would work.	I am using Ubuntu 20.04 LTS on a Surface Go, and it's working for me.

fv37w28	The Worst Head of CTU	I’m a bit confused by this. Alberta Green was a character on the show in 2002. Erin Driscoll was 2004-2005 and Alberta Watson died in 2015.

He was redeemed in s2 with his storyline.   Alberta Green was awful at the job. Glad she didn't last long.

fvdtdx4	Always check Second hand/Charity stores when looking for vintage games. Here’s why	Dang, that's a good find.	For 2 dollars thats a very decent price, I also seen Mario kart double dash for less than a dollar but i already have it, kinda regret not picking it up considering how cheap it was	I went to a second hand store and got Wii Fit along with the balance board for like 2 dollars, which is significantly less of an achievement, but, hey, I'm not complaining.	They were also selling Nintendo power magazines for about 30 cents each. They were in bad condition but there were loads there so I’m thinking about going back there tomorrow to see what else I can get. Thing is with second hand stores is that nothing is expensive there and your likely to find loads of vintage games for a cheap price, I’m glad I got paper Mario TTYD for such a cheap price as I wasn’t willing to pay about $90 on ebay for the game.	0

fvoccou	6/22/2020 In the last 24 hours there have been 297 new confirmed COVID-19 cases in Maryland. There has now been a total of 64,603 confirmed cases.	Maryland had more deaths than NYC, the American epicenter, yesterday.   Is Maryland really doing that well?  3000 people are dead. That's more than entire countries	Its why I reiterate in my previous posts. Maryland has done very well managing these cases, but now its summer and people are going to move around a lot. FL, TX and now AZ are hot spots. With Florida being a vacation state, please take in consideration of how you can be safe if you choose to travel there.	I'm begging everyone, please continue to take this seriously. I have several friends living in Florida and Texas who have family in the hospital with this. It's truly horrific to see an otherwise healthy person reduced to assisted breathing in the span of 10 days. While we're doing much better, it's because Maryland (for the most part) embraced a culture of quarantine and mask wearing. That goes away if we let our guard down before this thing is really and truly under control.	None	0

fwb51k9	If I get an invisibility and fly spell on myself, do I have to roll for stealth in the air?	Invisibility, according to the rules, gives advantage on Stealth checks.	Yep. Your clothes still rustle, you still breathe. You still need to avoid obstacles. A DM might give you advantage on said stealth check.	None	It does not, this is what invisibility gives you:  >An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature's location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.   >   >Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature's **attack rolls have advantage.**  It makes you heavily obscured, which makes your attackers effectively blinded, here's what that does:  >A blinded creature can't see and ***automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.***   >   >***Attack rolls against the creature have advantage***, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.  You cannot be detected by vision, but you can still be tracked by sound as normal while invisible, and flying would likely make that harder, hence what I said about advantage. The perks to invisibility are that even if you are found you cannot be ***attacked*** without disadvantage, and it gives you advantage on attacks to everyone else. Additionally, because you cannot be tracked by sight, it means you can take the hide action without breaking eye-line with your attacker, so you can "hide" while still in the open.  It does not confer advantage on stealth checks.	0
fwbixi3	Stranger Things	I've now watched up to the start of season 3, and I still think she reads as autistic. From what I've seen of her life in the lab, she seems to have had too much social interaction for institutional autism.	Well you're only part way through the season. So I'll put a spoiler in here that I advise you NOT read unless you really want to but would explain why she isn't autistic. **But no, I severely doubt it (I would say definitely, but not being the writer, technically I could never know)**  Spoiler:  >!She's just completely starved of any childhood didn't grow up socialising in anyway, a complete lab rat for the government and also has unique "gifts"/powers which would stipulate she's different anyway. It will be mostly because she wasn't really a child, that she never actually learnt anything about socialisation, and on top of that had severe trauma, which would come across as autistic seeming in reality, but it almost certainly wouldn't be diagnosed based on that past.!<	None	Nah I don't think so. She was starved of any childhood, used, abused, isolated, kept in solitary, forced to be part of experimentation, suffered trauma. The list goes on. It would definitely be exclusion from an ASD diagnosis.   It would sooner be PTSD and lack of learning for example IMO. especially because she also then learns many social things very quickly later on which would also suggest its not neurological, she just never originally learnt.	0

Not sure whether you understand what philosophy is man	philosophy, where science ends.	At least as far as I am concerned, and I can totally be wrong, metaphysics have not been seriously entertained since the ancient greeks. So even though I am sure there currently are metaphysical philosophers now, they are by no means influential.

The protection that deflection offers isn't super relevant if you're not getting hit in the first place.  The only time I'm not disappointed to see Athena any more is when I'm trying to set up Merciful End.

And Gibson isn’t exactly doing great with quality lately.  Get the Epiphone and enjoy it. If you find a Gibson that you like somewhere along this musical journey, then get it and you have both.

I'd say prepare for it like you would for a normal trip but don't expect anything special, but who knows maybe it'll floor you, acid can be funny like that.	It wasnt in light I put it inside the box thing in the car (idk if its called middle console or what lol) and I left it there for one night	Some of that LSD will have broken down due to the direct light and the heat. The tab is now likely contains less than 100ug, but depending on how long it was left there you'll probably still trip, it just won't be a full 100ug trip.	None	0
g0jb25e	Is 11mg okay for a first time (nasal)?	Don't snort pills. Snorting 2c-b in general hurts more than most drugs but 2c-b pills will hurt like a motherfucker with all those binders and excipients.	Thanks for the reply man I appreciate it! I'm hoping to get 4 ~22mg pills but might only be able to get 2 (one for me and one for gf) and was thinking if we should do it in 1/2 or 1/3's but knowing the pills are usually under dosed, I think we'll crush it up and split it into 2 doses (each)	Tolerance is basically nonexistent, you can redose really easily after you peak and get to the same or higher levels unlike psychedelics, redosing is made especially easy with the nasal roa due to it's short duration of action. I don't really see any reason why you can't start small and work upwards unless you have limited supplies. Nasal is about 2x more bioavailabile than oral, so 11mg nasal is approx. 22mg oral.	The pros of sniffing really outweigh the cons from me tbh like I will happily take the pain than have to wait 45-60 mins for a pill to kick in and feel nauseous. We are doing it in the evening as well and don't want to be up all morning  Edit: and unfortunately 2cb powder pretty much doesn't exist in the UK	0

g4iker0	In Honour of Teachers on the First Day of School (kinda)	The simplest argument against is that it takes money out of the public system, thereby weakening it. It’s like a private country club taking money out of the national parks, thereby making their services worse. It’s just a ploy to funnel tax dollars into private, for profit companies.	One thing that always surprises me is that The West Wing always presents the other side of the argument and at the end I'm always leaning towards the sides of vouchers	None	Charter schools are one thing. But if you take money and allow a kid like Charlie to go to Gonzaga instead of his public school in DC, he ends up on a track where he ends up at Harvard and Yale.

g8v07yf	Creating an actual product from my dev board project	[https://embeddedcomputing.weebly.com/sensortag-cc1350.html](https://embeddedcomputing.weebly.com/sensortag-cc1350.html)  IIRC the ESP has 7uA draw in the deepest sleep. I've not used any MCU's for extreme low power consumption. Perhaps the ESP draws more power per action than the other mentioned MCU's. Anything under 15uA can last about a year on a 200mAh battery (ignoring voltage drop towards the end of life).	Out of curiosity; I thought the esp32 was pretty good for now power applications. Could you elaborate?	esp32 is not very lowerpower.... not sure if it supports true BLE. but something like a cc1350 from TI can run from a coin-cell for a long time with BLE, or maybe an nRF part like the nRF528 series. For the Ti part you can check out the SensorTag dev kit. Or STM32WB  too	None	0
g8xtuu0	Is there a way to measure how random a sequence is?	They're statistical, so they don't say anything definitively. They're very good at ruling out sequences which *aren't* random, but that's not the same as proving a sequence is "truly random", if such a thing even is well-defined. Pi isn't really "random" at all, in the sense that there's an extremely simple formula to calculate any particular digit of it without having to know the previous digits.  Additionally, pi has an infinite number of decimal digits, so we could only ever test a subset of them. It may be that much farther down the number places, it suddenly takes on a very structured pattern.  That being said, AFAIK mathematicians have tried very hard to rule out Pi's being "random" and have not been able to do so yet.	Have these tests been applied using the  digits of pi as the RNG? What would a positive result mean?	There are big batteries of statistical tests that you can put a random number generator through. For example, if your RNG is based on a certain type of algorithm called "Linear Congruential Generator", you can use a "spectral test":   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_test	That's why I'm curious. The digits of pi are absolutely not random. They are completely fixed. But my expectation is that they would satisfy statistically random tests. Trivially, for example, that 10% of the digits over from some large sample would be '7'. It is completely wrong to say that the 78479th digit of pi has a 10% probability of being seven; it has 100% probability of being whatever it is and 0% probably of being anything else, but if I had to guess what some digit was, I'd expect to be right 10% all the time. But this is conjecture.	0
g8yqt2h	How to fix this? (Details in comment)	Reddit when someone gives a solution:  Reddit when someone says that it is indeed the problem: UPVOTE!	In my case this error happened when esp8266 chip (but this may happen on esp32 boards) was bad soldered to PCB. I checked UART and found problem, then solded properly and my board got alive. But without micro-USB (I use external USB-TTL now for that board), because I accidentally tear off him when looking for a problem without multimeter :)  So I suggest check soldering. (Sorry for bad english)	List of things to check  1. USB cable has data line(not just a charging cable) 2. Check that the board is indeed powering up 3. Check that the serial port is not connected to another device during programming 4. Check that you have the correct board selected  5. Check Baud rate of the connection required for the project 6. Check that you have permission to use the serial port for the programming ide 7. Check if any pins need to be set high/low to program the board 8. Check that Leds are flashing during programming 9. If you have another board try that and see if the problem is persistent across boards 10. Try programming another device (other esp to what's being used). 11. Check the esptool github issue page for the board and use keywords "upload connection issues"  Hope this helps	None	0

g9al6gg	Why are 100gr frangible 9mm bad for XD pistols?	We are currently working on changing the bullet design and tweaking the charge for more reliability in all handguns.	Ah that's exactly the explanation I was looking for. Thx for responding with the details	Hello I work for lax ammo and the frangible ammunition you're talking about is from one of our first batches. It uses a truncated bullet design that has had some feeding issues with the feed ramp of an XD. Not all XDs have this issue, but we have noticed that of the ammunition returned a good portion of them were fired out of XDs. Also the lighter bullet does have reduced recoil which can be difficult to fully cycle shorter springs. In my opinion though, I have tested this ammo along with my colleagues and we came to the conclusion that limp wristing is the main issue with this type of ammunition failing to cycle.	None	0
g9gafaf	French police charging firefighters	You cannot directly compare US wages with other countries, many European countries have low wages because of higher taxes, but in return you get healthcare, pension, etc.  It's better to look at purchasing power.	For 30 years???? WTF? And people say wages in America are awful? Even Walmart voluntarily raised their minimum wage a few times.	For context, in France for over nine months now, these firefighters are protesting in Paris for a higher pay.  Their salary hasn't improved since 1990 and when the government rejected their plea of better commodities, the firefighters started protesting.   The police violence has been real bad in France for quite few years now and they are commanded to quell the protests.  As of 2020, median of a French household's income is around €40,000 per year whilst median of a firefighter's is €26,000. (Excluding taxes)  Edit: The protests have begun since late January.  Edit 2: To people who say my median income is inaccurate, I produced this number after inspecting various sources. The median amount is more or less the same.	None	0

But from an objective POV, it seems like Trump is trying to lose. Why else would he be so adamant about grotesquely lying the public with his taxes, big rona, tell the proud boys to "stand back and stand by" (there are so many other examples but that would take forever).

Sometimes she just doesn't know what to do and floats on the spot, and god the noise is absolutely horrifying, all of those pylons will make overlapping sounds with no apparent limit.

Sorry if this comes out as harsh but that doesn't sound like enjoying life, it sounds like escaping life.

Some recommendations : take a walk in nature, read a book, call a friend.       Also, when I was feeling a bit like yourself, I tried lots of stuff online in terms of "personality tests".

gfasxuc	Not normal content but I've been #FaithfulThen #FaithfulNow	Happy to chat about it and I can tell you what it means to me but it may mean different things to other people so I' not talking for everyone :-)  it's 2 different things so I'll do the easy bit first the he/him refers to my preferred pronouns. People thought I was trans and were using female pronouns (which is a normal and polite thing to do) so I was saying I us he and him to describe myself and prefer other people to do the same.   The gender fluid bit is a bit harder to explain as I'm still working it all out myself, but I am mostly male presenting in how I look and dress. People know me as a man but that's not really quite how I feel. I also enjoy presenting as female at times and often somewhere in between so it may be just a bit of makeup and my normal jeans and t-shirt or a dress and wearing my boobs. It's not just a sexual thing although it is kind of liked to that as well. It's also mixed up with the idea that gender norms are really stupid and if girls can wear jeans boys should be able to wear dresses and makeup and it not be thought of as weird. The fluid part is because how I feel changes, sometimes more masculine and sometimes more feminine.  Hope that helps, but feel free to ask more questions	Can you help me understand exactly what gender fluid he/him means? Not trying to press just genuinely curious. And go Niners!	None	None	0

gfj7nnn	Possible bankruptcy reform being debated. Legislation currently being discussed would enable a new "Chapter 10" bankruptcy, that would treat student loans like credit card debt.	This is such grandstanding its amazing. There is a reason why 99% of the bills representatives file don't go anywhere. It isn't because enough people didn't call/write their rep. Its because they file them with no intention of having them pass or promoting them.   There is no political will to let people easily discharge student loans in bankruptcy. From the right OR from the left. Its not going to go anywhere.	> I'm always amazed at how people continually fall for this and the student loan forgiveness bills. Any representative can file any bill about anything. 99% of them have no chance of passing and are done to appease their base and do some political showboating. Realistically speaking, there is a ~1% chance that anything like this passes.  Bills pass or fail based on how many votes they get. You, and every American citizen, have the power to call, write, email, or maybe even visit your elected representatives (or their aides) and voice your support for the legislation.  If they don't think that their constituents want them to vote for something... Remember, they're not mind readers.  So instead of being pessimistic, maybe try actually supporting this bill for all the good that it could do, if passed.

gfl0mqu	Thoughts on this? Reps. Tulsi Gabbard And Markwayne Mullin Introduce Bill That Would Allow Only Biological Females In Women’s Sports	Copying another Redditor’s comment:  &gt; Each sports governing body should be able to decide for itself  That's why the law is needed.  Without it, the governing body faces descrimination charges.  With it, they can make their own choice.	This is government overreach as far as I'm concerned.  I don't think the government should be telling sports organizations that they *must* include transgender women, nor that they *must exclude* transgender women.  I'd like to see a law that gives sports organizations the authority to *choose* which way they will go.  Women's soccer, basketball, running, cycling, etc., may all choose to exclude transgender women.  But women's curling, billiards, archery, shooting, motorsports, middle school sports, etc., might not.  It should be up to each organization to decide for themselves what to do.	None	None	0
gfxphmu	Souls (and indie) games have affected how I enjoy other games...	There are relatively few “quests”, but the open world is incredibly full in the sense that you can interact with almost everything.   It is wonderful for just exploring and messing around with the environment and finding new things to do, or new ways to approach/fight enemies.  It’s not so great if you want to be *told* what to do, or if you care a lot about NPCs with deep stories.	Wait really? BOTW to me has been the most gigantic world filled with nothing to do. Sure there are lots of shrines, but the rest is filled with basically nothing. Cool looking scenery and the occasional bad guys, but I never felt like there was anything to actually do. Maybe I need to go back and give it another go? But man did I just end up wandering around doing not a lot in that game.	I completely agree. I was stoked to play The Outer Worlds, but it just didn't do it for me. The open world just ended up feeling like padding, and the systems were great in small contained locations but fell apart as they branched out.  The only big open world game that I've enjoyed recently is Breath of the Wild, because it rarely felt like a big world. It felt like I was in small discreet areas with systems that worked properly and consistently.	None	0

Lol these regulators are dumb, people made Robinhood accounts knowing full well the risk they were taking and if you didn't you're just stupid. I don't think me making dumb calls on shit I have no idea about and losing money is Robinhood's fault, its my fault for making dumb calls. What happened to personal responsibility and individual fault?	Is a person at fault for receiving bad medical treatment? Is a person at fault for a mechanic purposefully fucking up their car in an obscure way? Is a person at fault for buying a product that is different than advertised? Is a person at fault for roofers installing a roof that leaks?  No, and that's why we have consumer protection laws. We are a nation primarily driven by consumption so these types of guardrails are integral for consumer sentiment and market integrity. Of course people should be less naive with their money and you can't regulate away stupidity, but we can do a better job at being transparent with incentives and execution.	0

gg4eoh8	brilliant analysis right here	Fr, when I was 18 working at Asda (UK Walmart) sometimes I would be outside pushing the trollies from the car park back inside and if someone asked us to help take their shopping their car we would, and often people would then try and say we could keep the pound you put in the trollies as a deposit (not sure if you do that in the US) and our bosses said if we ever accepted it we would be sacked lmao	This dork thinks that cashier's are like the well-paid lapdogs of the bourgeoisie.  Meanwhile, I can't even accept tips without getting fired.	I don't demand a fee for anything, I scan items because my boss tells me to and most people pay for them because social norms dictate that you hand the cashier money after hearing the total read out.

ggems8b	What’s the best way to encrypt a home dir that’s already in use?	Honest answer: I think if you are unsure about the internals I recommend you reinstall and let the installer do it for you because the manual steps are not that much faster and are not so easy. (Unless you want to learn it in that case read up on full-disk encryption with luks.)  As long as you make sure you have a backup of your whole /home folder you should be fine. I assume you made no heavy modifications outside of your personal folder. If you recopy everything later that will work. I recommend 2 external hdds and rsync for that. Make at least 2 backups and make sure you really have everything.	Its just ext4 I think. How would I go about encrypting everything?	Are you using LVM? What file system is your home dir on? Also if you want to unlock on boot, consider encrypting everything.	[This article](https://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/posts/encrypting-your-home-directory-using/) makes it seem pretty straightforward.

ggtp1jb	.41 Magnum Versus .357 for hunting	I would stay out of the .41 for a lot of reasons, non of which have to do with the caliber.  So, I will focus on 44 v 357, both are nice in a lever, and neither will be anywhere near the 7mm-08, especially in a featherweight.        For those saying use 38 or 44 spl, or light loads at the range, I think you should practice what you hunt, never train your muscle memory different aim points, have the sights adjusted, etc for a different load.  If you want something light hitting and cheap for trigger time, get a .22lr in the same platform and shoot that.  But be sure to also get a couple hundred hunting rounds through your main platform at hunting ranges every year.            I have levers in both 44 and 357, when I carried either after deer, it was the 44, but that was limited to when I hunted brush.  That said, the 357 is very easy to shoot.          If it was me choosing, I would do the 44 for hunting, but I honestly don't think you could go wrong with either.	Oh I mean for actual hunting I never notice recoil. The only concern is something that works better for my 110lbs soaking wet spouse for practice, since her featherweight 7mm-08 is a little...stiff for extended practice.  Sounds like for that I can use 44 SPL.	Deer hunter and lever action enthusiast here  Honestly I’d recommend the .44 magnum. I’ve never heard of the .41 and while the .357 will get it done your shot placement will have to be much batter than if you used a .44  Also if it’s recoil youre worried about think about it like this: when deer hunting you usually only shoot once. I’m also not sure if you’ve ever shot .44 magnum from a rifle but the recoil isn’t very bad, definitely not too much different from other deer rounds  In general what you save for in recoil is going to be sacrificed in range and killing power on the deer  Also it’s your rifle, so do whatever you want. If it’s the recoil you’re worried about than do what you’ve gotta do, it’s your rifle and we don’t get a say in what you do	None	0

gh0mxmi	Very high heart rate on minimal effort	My resting heart rate during sleep (I wear an Apple Watch 5 during sleep) is between 58 to 67 or so, each night. Goes as low as 52, as high as 72, while sleeping. I also get my heart rate down pretty quickly after exercise. For example, if I do kettlebell swings for 30 seconds, my heart rate goes to 155 or so, then goes down to 120 in 1 minute and back to 90 in about 2 minutes, if I lay on the bed.	NAD. I can relate. My resting heart rate used to be 120. When I would perform normal activity, it would be at least 150. I have always been an emotional person. I heard about sleep apnea, went for a diagnosis and turns out I had sleep apnea. The prescribed  device gave me nightmares and stopped using it within couple of days. I came across something called pranayama(breathing exercises) and started practicing it. I perform couple of variations for a total of at least 30 minutes everyday. Ever since then I have been so calm and dont get emotional at all. My normal heart rate now is in 70s.it even gets to 50s while laying down. I get the max of 170 when performing HIIT exercise.

Give him around $20 mill for 4 years. Next offseason we can trade Kuzma, Schroder, and Caruso for Harden  His former agent is Rob Pelinka. Lakers would be the only way to redeem him (Dwight).

gh7p9fe	Seeing that some of u guys may have trouble with the Tigers from the dark tower level 24. Here is a little clip which might help u guys.

Currently I have marina with weapon, nari, lahn with weapon, beth, vishuvac, alef, and plitvice, with idol eva's weapon as well. Seeing as you have beth's weapon, would you recommend it as something to grab or should I get something else and hope to get it from rolling epic weapons in the shop? My current main team is marina, beth, shapira, and karina if that impacts anything.	Thanks:) the trick is to get both with beths weapon skill and kill the tiger which is without the bombing mechanic. Then trigger her chain skill on the tiger with the bombing mechanic. Then just do dmg and you got it.	now that was quick .... good job man	I would say the same as grith:) waiting for the monthly weapon box can help a lot to decide what to get next.	0
gh9a1jp	OBS Won't Complete "Stopping Stream" After My Stream Dies	Ok, I haven't tried the exact same setup (same game, etc) so I can't say for certain, but it might have been solved by a restart (silly as that sounds) because my last stream didn't have that issue.  That said, if the issue is what you say, that might still be the problem. I'll keep this comment in my back pocket just in case!	I think I had the same issue pop up for me.  After updating to the newest version, I started dropping frames in my stream until the video basically froze. (Frames were getting dropped at the encoder, not the render or network.)  What I think caused it was an overloaded video card - I was using my video card to encoder both my stream and my recording while Skype was using the video card for it's encoding as well - and my GPU was getting pegged out at 100%.  I moved my recording encoding back to my CPU and left the stream/Skype on the video card. This brings my GPU usage down to 80%.    Since then I haven't had an issue.	None	None	0

The study gave people the choice to strongly disapprove, somewhat disapprove, somewhat approve, or strongly approve, and in creating these 70 and 80+ percent who support restrictions, the researchers combined the somewhats and the stronglies. There also isn’t a graphical breakdown of the distribution between somewhats and stronglies in the linked paper.	This data is shocking to me, I live in a relatively wealthy part of MA and there are a lot of people getting pissed off about the lockdowns, especially schools and restaurants.  In addition all the private schools are open and full of students so there are plenty of students and parents who don't feel the need to go into full shelter.  Maybe it's a self selecting group because all the pro-lockdown people are hiding in their rooms and I don't talk to them.

Thankfully I have only one month left on my 70mg, and I haven't gotten a single new face acne in the last 25 days. Really happy with the results, although I still have redness from older acne that will take months to properly fade.	Hey man. I feel your pain. Mine isnt that bad anymore but it still messes with my head for sure. Ive been on Accutane for a couple months now and all I can do is hope for the best.

I seriously can't understand that people think we're the conspiracy theorists when the other side is the one who would beat you into compliance within an inch of your life "for the greater good" and who are so paranoid they have to have all these insane restrictions and have it seen to that no one steps out of line just so they don't have to worry their little heads about killing grandma.

gi3z3re	Why did tilly become first officer?	I don't agree she wasn't falling apart. She's very anxious a lot of the time and doesn't inspire command. Burnham is the obvious second in command but her subplots are really detracting her character. I think this was a 100% fan choice by the showrunners to save a series which is losing viewership	Because she was the only one of the bridge crew not falling apart, she was adapting well to the 32c tech, she was managing people under her command efficiently, she's liked by every crewmate and did the right thing when Michael went behind Saru on the unsanctioned mission	None	None	0
gi3zhrv	Why did tilly become first officer?	Wouldn't that kinda imply that the show really needed an additional strong-willed character? Maybe someone from the  future that wanted to join the ship (and wasnt 16 years old)?	Probably because hers is the only storyline that has really been fleshed out in a significant way. Stamets runs the warp drive, culber is the doctor, and aside from Burnham and saru, Tilly is the only one who has been explored much at all.	None	None	0

gi5tx6g	What does it mean to be a Board Control faction in 40k?	Well that was a good pick because I'm creating a silver tide style army with necrons along side my boyz heavy orks.    This shows me that My play style has been leaning towards it board control spam all along.	Disclaimer: I don't play as or against board control armies, so take my explanation with a mountain of salt.  From what I've heard, "board control" means denying your opponent access to the objectives. This is usually done by flooding the board with bodies that they'll need to cut through or by pushing/pressuring your opponent to back away from a tanky and/or deadly unit. Because half of the victory points in 9th require you to take and hold objectives (called primaries), preventing your opponent from a being able to move onto an objective is a clear road to victory.   Traditionally, armies that employ this strategy are hordes, which force the opponent to kill tons of models to access the objectives. Orks, Tyranids, Daemons can all run horde lists, although conceivably you could use tons of Necron Warriors or Battle Sisters if you wanted tougher but more expensive units. I'm not sure which are best ATM, but you shouldn't use current power level to pick your faction anyway.	None	None	0

Try something like What Remain of Edith Finch.  Starting off with Red Dead or Uncharted would be way too much if you're dads not familiar with game controls at all.

Lol did Vitalik just put the final nail in coffin on OMG with plasma usability. Plasma section was almost entirely negative.	Audit incentives for rollups are not perfected and has limited TPS until data availability on shards occur sometime in 2021... Probably late 2021 after stability tests are done.

The fine moss dust makes a great covering. Otherwise I meticulously pick small bits from one of the more grass like fake mosses and super glued it places that made sense to me. I used Vallejo "Thick mud" texture paste for mud. Try to group the mud and the greenery. Finally I used the tips of fake ferns to make miniature ferns. I then was all the stuff I've added with a brown wash and do some streaking with Vallejo smoke.   Everything is added after most of the painting is done although I come back with a bit of brown wash and streaking as I'm adding it to the greenery. The paint scheme is very simple just Undercoat black then zenith a grey-white overtop, wash with a green, wash crevices with brown, make the glowing parts green and highlight with a yellow and white.    Hope that helps!	great stuff, I'm going for a swamp theme and would love some gallery pics of these for a closer look.

It's also the one game I have the most hours in.  It's led to me ignoring all my other games, and to pretty much give up watching TV.  It led me down the rabbit hole that is playing bass parts since you can emulate a bass with your guitar.  That cost me more money when a bass followed me home from the music store.  It's led me to try all kinds of songs I would never have tried otherwise.  It keeps making my kids take over my computer so they can play rocksmith too.

Raids suck, Tower sucks and honestly, the FFT combat system doesn't really lend itself to creative Boss Trials like FFBE's did. * The piss-poor UI and how user-unfriendly it is - TOO MANY TAPS (despite cutting down the #, it's not enough), the Shop Bug which is related to that (Amazon shop banner), and just how much better it should be considering it comes from both Gumi (who had years of FFBE experience) and Squeenix (I mean really)  The scariest part is that I had to think about what I like, but the list of disliked things I could easily continue on with.

gjatjst	Inspecting a crack in the Pantheon's dome, 1925	The guy in the cap certainly appears unconcerned.	I love this picture because it gives a better sense than any other I've seen of the sheer size of this structure, built in the 2nd century AD. Cracks like this one are still visible if you look closely at the dome; they have been covered up by a mortar or cement slightly lighter than the rest of the surface. This covering is simply cosmetic rather than structural, as this engineer explains:  >Too often, were trying to make old structures conform to theories we learned for steel and concrete, he says. Those materials remain strong under immense stresses in modern buildings. But buildings like the Pantheon stand because of their geometry, he says, and the way builders conceived them was really through their geometry. Cracks and deformations, he argues, are not necessarily flaws; theyre often a sign that a building adapted to a sinking foundation centuries ago and found a new conformation.

gjc7uv2	[Star Trek Discovery] The year is 2255 - SQL injections remain Starfleets biggest threat	SQL? Hell, if Starfleet works like most bureaucracies, there's probably still a bunch of vintage 20th century IBM Z-series mainframes in the basement of Starfleet HQ in San Francisco, churning away doing something hilariously critical like making sure Earth's anti-invasion planetary defenses remain operational.  The mainframes are scheduled for replacement and there's an entire Starfleet IT Modernization task group working to make it happen, but they keep having to re-scope and re-draft the RFP because the managers keep screwing with the requirements.  Meanwhile, the only place Starfleet can source maintenance for the mainframes is a Ferengi company, which means Starfleet has to keep maintaining an active ITAR exemption just to keep its systems up. The Ferengi demand a massive amount of latinum per month, but they actually do deliver pretty good support—they even have a 4-hour turnaround on break/fix and replacement parts, though every once in a while you notice a FICON connector with teeth marks on it....	I guarantee large organizations will still be using SQL in 2255.	None	None	0

gjd0bg3	Why does 40 hours a week seem so miserable. Am I just destined to hate working all of the time?	Ah, classic Reddit. Capitalism sucks? I mean sure it has its ills, but it's responsible for almost every innovation you take for granted today. I challenge you to spend just 1 day not using any products/services from the 10 largest companies by market cap.  It's incredible how quick people are to hate capitalism while simultaneously tremendously benefitting from it on a day-to-day basis.  Capitalism is also responsible for lifting billions of people out of poverty over the past 50 years.	It's not that adult life sucks.  It's that capitalism sucks.	Yeah. Adult life sucks.   I am almost 2 years removed from college and it only took 3 months of working 40 hour weeks in a corporate environment where everybody breathes their profession (and honestly, sucks their company’s d**k), for me to develop a plan to escape.   The plan involves putting up with it now and moving frugally, until I can afford to quit and take a calmer job for less pay.	Capitalism's crowning achievement is 26 people having more wealth than half the planet.  And ah yes, the old "capitalism made your iphone argument".  Just because capitalism makes something doesn't mean only capitalism makes things.  Besides, everything is made by capitalism at the moment so it's a non-statement.	0

In the infamous words of VaushV, should consuming child porn be legal? Yes, that would be more legal and morally consistent yes. 100%. Bro, no one is arguing whether or not child slavery is morally bad. Of course child slavery is bad, but cp is worse in the sense that one day, we will evolve from using children as slaves. There will be and already are ethical ways to stop children from being slaves, but there are no ethical or any possible ways to separate children from cp. I agree that both are horrible but cp is worse, again, because you can remove labor from children eventually, but you cant remove children from cp at all.	https://twitter.com/beigegoat45/status/1325705005886746624?s=20  "The answer should be that ALL of these things are bad"	None	0

A Saints fan in one of the /r/nfl threads also linked [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/aew5k7/were_new_orleans_saints_reporter_jeff_duncan_and/edt9wwj/). Which is an AMA from a few years back with a Saints beat writer, when asked about Campbells prospects as a HC, the writer says he thinks Campbell definitely will get a HC job and that he would be able to assemble a strong staff.   I'm lukewarm on the hire myself, but for some reason NFL people seem to think Campbell would have no issue assembling a good staff of coordinators.	I see DanO's point on seeing different teams and locker rooms to see what works, and that's great from an organization stand point, but what about who he's going to bring with him? He'd be jumping to a role he's only temporarily had before (not a bad thing), but game day decisions, scheming, and play calling is a whole other ball game. We already experienced a coach that was great 6 out of 7 days a week in Caldwell who was a players coach, but struggled game day. Does that mean he'd bring in OC or DC that had that experience before to help him?	None	None	0

gjh8ycn	Real Estate agent arrested for Capitol insurrection says she deserves a pardon. “I feel like I was basically following my president. I was following what we were called to do. He asked us to fly there. He asked us to be there. So I was doing what he asked us to do,”	I mean the situation of the nazi was very different. I know its nice to make the nazi comparrisson to explain that it was bad, but that honestly does not really do justice to either.   The nazi litterally tried to systematically exterminate an entire ethnicity, and the people were part of a large system in which they played specific(and non-specific) roles. A lot of those nazi's argued that they simply did what they were ordered to do in a big system, of which they did not all know what the actual end result was (not that that absolves them of guilt, loads of nazi's and collaborators knew the people who were sendt to concentration camps were not expected to return).  This is a singular group of people attacking the democracy of their own country. In order to overthrow the democratic proces to keep their favored leader in charge.  Im not saying its not bad (because duh it is, very bad) but why does everything have to be compared to nazi's? More than 6 **million** people died during the nazi terror, 6 people died during the riot at the Capitol.  Comparing the Trump insurectionists to nazi's does no good, the nazi's were working on the extermination of an entire race and by comparing this to the Capitol assault not only downplays the suffering of the Jewish people under the nazi terror, it also weakens your stance because its much easier to discard hyperbole than its is straight facts.  Edit: am european too	As a European, I am quite glad that so many people are making this link unprompted. I was starting to worry about the historical awareness of the people of the United States.	Nazis used the same excuse	>The nazi litterally tried to systematically exterminate an entire ethnicity,  Eventually. It took them decades to start building death camps, and even then most Nazis had no idea they existed. It's a popular but wrong opinion that "they can't be like Nazis unless they have a genocide plan". At the time they were running for election, the Nazis didn't even threaten mass deportations; they wanted segregation. The genocide was much later, and very secret.  The comparison is completely apt.	0

gjkidnm	“We only invented the word organic because we made things inorganic. We only invented the word natural because we made things unnatural. We only invented the word permaculture because we made agriculture.” ― Khang Kijarro Nguyen	agriculture is intentional cultivation of plants and/or animals for human use, permaculture certainly falls under this, also do you have evidence of permaculture being used by ancient societies? I have heard that claim but never seen evidence to back it up, from my understanding humans spent a hundred thousand years as hunter gatherer societies before the foundation of agriculture which began with the cultivation of grain around 6000bc and that has been the predominate model since. Permaculture as a concept doesnt even appear until the 20th century	Agriculture implies the supposed "removal" of nature from food growing usually for the purpose of producing a monocrop absent as much ecological interference as possible. Permaculture implies either the augmentation / manipulation of an existing ecology or the creation of an artificial but self-sustaining ecology. AFAIK permaculture practices predate agricultural practices. So I don't know if I'd call it agriculture.	Permaculture is, by definition, a form of agriculture	None	0

He really loved Jenna and Jax - He simple got consumed by greed and by violence.  So apart from the sole appearence point - I would rather see a "Ragnar Like"-Travis as young Clay or even Piney.

gjljkfo	My Catastrophization OCD got from one to the other in just 3 steps!	Do what you can, not what you should.   As weird as that sounds, that's the most concise way i can summarize it. To begin with, there is no ethical consumption under capitalism, so there is that. But also, what people *should* do is impossible to do, because there is hardly enough money and infrastructure for it. What you *can* do however, is to minimize the suckiness you bring in to the world: You can buy meat and eggs, but try to do so from free range places, or ones where you can make certain they are kept more humanely. Find the meeting point of what you can afford and what's best for the environment. If you are in a rural place, try raising your own animals. 95% of my family's egg consumption comes from our own free range chicken who are happy af. Plastic can be reused, so try to find selective garbage bins near you. Or try buying paperbags, or washable textile ones.

gjnlyrv	To Those who Helped Fund the Film "Braid" (2018): How Did That Turn Out?	Im a film programmer and you absolutely *do not* need major studios to get an indie movie into cinemas.   That doesnt even make sense from a structural standpoint. Independent films are by nature outside the studio system. Studios have nothing to do with what theatres program. Theatres can program literally anything they want as long as they get the licensing to do so. No studio has any say into the distribution and screening of any other studio.  Some studios (ex. Disney) do have contracts in which you have to deal with multiple films from them, i.e. if you want the new Marvel you also have to take X Disney movie, and they both have to play on X amount of screens for X amount of weeks, with X amount of daily showings. That can cause issues with booking other films, but that a residual effect.  And cinemas have no obligation to follow any kind of "censorship regulations." Any theatre can show whatever type of movie they like. Any theatre can show an unrated or X rated film if they want to. Most simply choose not to for business reasons.  Youve kind of got it backwards. The reason governing bodies for film ratings like the MPAA exist is mostly for the ability of distribution. So that distributors can say that theyve passed a somewhat standardized test. For the most part all of that happens before the distribution process even begins.  Just want to clear things up.	Depends on the platform that you release the movie on.  You still need the support of major studios to get an indie movie into cinemas.   Once it's in cinemas, you have to adhere to censorship regulations (e.g. cursing, nudity, etc.)	Got some mails about film festivals and reviews, never received any money but since the movie didn't make much I guess that's fair.  I loved the idea, still do, of crowdfunding movies to avoid censorship or meddling from big studios that want to cater to the masses.	None	0

No doubt your mother also uses the siblings to get them to fight with each other - like pawns.	Yeah, I am really devastated right now but I am glad to be done. I hope they all just fuck off forever and I don't have to speak to amy of them ever again. When people ask me if I have siblings, I will just tell them no.	You are their scapegoat. They know they can treat you horrible, blame you for all their problems, an you still were nice and helped them. Your Mom taught them it's ok to do that. You have to protect you and yours from these horrible people. They are not good people, but users. Stay strong, block them, let them fight amongst themselves.	Oh I don't doubt that about my mom at all.   But telling them off? Look, any time you give a narcissist your energy, you are feeding them.

Mg per mg they are much stroger that aas. Compare a 500mg/ week test cycle with a 70mg LGD/ week cycle.

gjp7jh7	[Post Game Thread] The New Orleans Pelicans (5-7) defeat the Sacramento Kings (5-9), 128 - 123	I mean, he’s played 12 NBA games and is probably the best rookie so far. He’s got plenty of time to develop a more versatile offensive game.	I may be in the minority but as much as we all love Haliburton, i question whether he can be a full time starter in the league. He has so little ability to generate his own offense. Tonight he shot the ball 3 times in 23 minutes. Thats not really because he was being unselfish but because it takes him so long to get his shot off and because he isnt someone whos able to finish at the rim.   If hes on a team with multiple alpha #1 scoring options then sure, hell look great, but this Kings team really needs him to generate scoring for himself and that doesnt really seem like his M-O.

I've lived here just over a decade and there have been \~ 2 properly decent occasions where it heavily snowed over multiple days. There was 2017 and 2010.	None	I had just moved to Cambridge to study and I was really surprised as snow is so rare in the north western coastal town where I hail from. I thought it might happen every year! I remember walking along the river and seeing it frozen and I've got a great photo of my bike on Jesus Green surrounded by snow.   The 2017 one was also memorable for me as I have since bought a house outside of Cambridge. It was our first Christmas here and I bought a tree from a farm a bit across the fens and walked back carrying it over my shoulder. One of the single most Christmassy things I think I have ever done.   A lock in at the Salisbury Arms sounds amazing. I had a birthday lunch there once.	0
gjpmv6a	Do you have any unusual investments?	Hey OP I have some unopened Homelands boosters I bought in 1996.  Am I in the black yet?	Singles are tempting but agree much riskier! We go for a less risky approach with booster boxes :) we also have plenty of MTG friends who are obsessed with opening boxes so would easily be able to sell to them and avoid ebay fees - they've even scouted out some of our boxes already! We've seen people at Friday Night Magic drop 500 on boxes so we know there is a market there, my boyfriend had a lot of debt when I met him from being impulsive so this is a way for us to sit happily at the store playing without buying excessively (we buy snacks, drinks and the odd pack to support the store) whilst still getting a dopamine hit every quarter from scoping out our next box.	I'm in the mtg sphere too, but generally go for singles as its riskier, but the profit can be much better short term.   I did pick up a foil godzilla  set as well as some mint RL staples (mox diamond, wheel of fortune etc) as long term they will almost definitely do well.   Other than that, does crypto count anymore? Its a much riskier investment that say a vanguard, but I bought in during the last bear market and have since made x10 profits easily. I wouldn't risk asuch now, given the price has exploded, but given some big companies such as etoro, PayPal and even reddit themself have got in, it has the potential to be an incredible long term investment.

We know Eth took in $350M in transaction fees in 2020. If Eth's ONLY value proposition was to earn transaction fees from staking, it's total market cap would be unreasonable past anywhere between 10 to 20 times it's total transaction fees--given that investors expect a 5 to 10 percent yield from such an investment.  All additional market cap value would be wholly speculative--investors speculating on how much they MIGHT earn from transaction fees in the FUTURE.  I know that we have no way of knowing how much transaction volume GBV may bring onto the network, but I'd assume there would be some degree of reasonable and unreasonable expectations for this as well.

gjq5lzw	Hi engineers, I'm trying to make a heliostat for my dark apartment and I'm really stuck. Has anyone made something similar before and has any pointers? (I've been researching for days and just incredibly lost)	1) You can't get more surface area than a flat mirror of the same size no matter what clever thing you do.   2) Sunlight is REALLY bright. The way our eyes work, something that's ten times as bright seems "a little brighter". Bright moonlight is something like 1/10,000 as bright as full daylight . A square meter of mirror will bounce something like 500 watts of incandescent light in through the window. (a square meter of sunlight is 1000 watts, but the mirror's not going to be pointed straight at the sun for obvious reasons.)	You could always use a convex mirror, or multi-part mirror, no?

There need to be personnel changes to up the level of coaching and defensive talent.	did u not see the game? fox stole the ball twice from BI on ISO situations. fox can hold his own on defense. he just has mental lapses. just needs to stay consistent like everyone else on the team.	How do we change our team to improve our defense? Who needs to go, besides Walton, Buddy, and CoJo?  Haliburton appears to be our best defender. I’m not sure that Fox is that good of a defender, but he’s obviously untouchable. Bagley is not much of a defender, but we probably want to give him one more year to grow.

gjrubqr	Stigma of wanting to be fairly paid for work	They get away with it because you're nothing special and they could replace you in a day. There's always someone willing and eager to take your spot - potentially for even less money.  In contrast, the guy who mows the lawn at your school is someone who is hard to replace. It's tough to find people who show up every day to do hard work groundskeeping and do a decent job of it. That's why he makes more money than you.  The real problem is the disconnect between how you view yourself and how potential employers view you. You think it's 'unfair' that they don't view you as anything special while they think you're an easily replaced commodity.  If you want to bridge this disconnect, you need to think more like potential employers and understand what they value.	I really dont know how universities get away with it. For my stipend I officially work 20 hours a week so they can say Im paid $20 an hour. If I worked 20 hours a week Id be kicked out my PhD program within a month. Were paid $18,000 (USD) a year but required fees are $2,500 plus its $500 to park on campus. Based on my pay its about $2,300 a year in income taxes. So after taxes, fees and parking Im left with $13,100 to live off of for an entire year. Its not a livable income and I hate that nobody who has the power to change stipend amounts seems to care.	None	I think you underestimate the cost of turnover. Yes they could easily replace me with a new PhD student if I left but even if they had great past experience it would take them months if not years to train them to completely replace me.

gjrv6h5	Trump promoted N.M. official’s comment that ‘the only good Democrat is a dead Democrat.’ Now the man is arrested in the Capitol riot.	I have difficulty imagining a group of people more pathetic and insecure than what you're describing.

gjrvuj8	The Prince was such a nice guy though??	and he was the first Dickon Tarly in Game of Thrones before the recast	I really can't get over the fact that the prince from Bridgerton, the DJ from Pitch Perfect, and Cormac from Harry Potter are all played by the same guy.

gjrw3lt	The Prince was such a nice guy though??	I think part of it too was realizing that being the Duke of Hastings wasn't just about being a duke, having a title and a line, but also having a responsibility to his tenants. There were a couple of small mentions of the tenants saying good things about his father, which I found interesting. His father was a horrible father and husband, but he seemed to be good at managing the dukedom and looking after the tenants (something the steward fell down on). And it showed Simon taking an interest in the tenants' situation and doing that work.	I don't really think the point was him just changing his mind about children. Instead, he realized he didn't need to spend his life miserable to spite his father. He didn't not want them because he didn't want to be a father, he was just so determined to get back at his father that he would have rather been alone and miserable. While most people don't just change their mind on not wanting kids, many people can learn to get over a grudge and move forward from past trauma. He learned to deal with his emotional trauma by finding greater joys in life and acceptance in other.  Also if she married the prince she would be bored her whole life and constantly having s3x dreams of Simon. I really don't think they had any better future. You can't be with someone just because they're a "nice guy".	While Simon is gorgeous...I actually dont like that they end up together and he ends up giving in to having children bc it's completely unrealistic. In reality, most people who dont want children so adamantly do not change their minds. Their happiness would have been short lived. She should have married the prince and Simon should have stayed away from her...not pursued her into the garden. But alas, the show would not exist.	None	0

gjs3ncd	Please roast my sad resume. I want a help desk job.	Make an effort to tailor your resume to the jobs you want, and it basically writes itself.  If the job you are applying to mentions using and troubleshooting MS Office 2016, then literally write out "Using and troubleshooting Microsoft Office 2016" under a "skills" section.  If the job mentions navigating the command line, then sure, write down what you're capable of doing with it.	The thing is, I don't know how competent in something I should be to list it as a skill. For instance, I can navigate MS Office well enough to utilize each app, but I'm no expert. I don't want to list something that an interviewer would expect me to know more of than I do. As far as what I learned from my certs... most of it is very broad knowledge that didn't require anything hands on. For instance I know basic commands from Windows CLI like ipconfig, ping, tracert, how to navigate directories etc. Should I add something related to Command Line on my resume even though the complete capabilities of CLI are far out of my current scope?	You are massively underselling yourself here, make a skills section and list out the skills you learned on your degree and on the IT certs, don't assume everyone knows what you learned. Think of tools, software etc that you know how to use and stuff you know how to do	None	0
gjs45tg	Is it ever acceptable to ask for a counter offer with a current employer?	Yes.  You shouldn't be the one to ask them for a counter-offer, it's something they offer you.  And don't be offended if they don't offer one, OR don't offer you one immediately when handing in your notice.  Some companies just don't do counter-offers, or your boss might not know what he can offer you without talking to HR/his boss first.	So what youre saying is let them know I have another offer and am resigning, and then wait for them to say what could we do to keep you here?, and if they dont just work out the notice period and move on?	That would be a rather blunt and mercenary way of putting it. In general, you want your boss to offer to find a way to get you to stay prior to mentioning details. You say something like "hey boss, this has been a great place to work but I need to put in my notice." And then leave it alone. IT people tend to talk too much, here saying less is more. Let your boss make the next move and always let him keep things moving. Don't mention what you would need until asked.	None	0

This type of radio fell out of favor in the 1920's with the advent of vacuum tube but hobby kits are still available and work on modern broadcast	You know how when you put a fork in a microwave it makes sparks?

gjs8xe9	TheNeedleDrop quickly reviews SIGN/PLUS (and calls them “annoying white noise”)	Agreed, I've really soured on the idea of music critics as a whole. There isn't anything wrong with criticism, and I think it can be valuable in some sense to help move the art form forward. But critics have a big incentive to produce as many hot takes as possible, resulting in shallow and deliberately controversial reviews because that's what brings in viewers and makes money.  I much prefer people who focus on appreciation, analysis, history, and curation. Big shout-out to Deep Cuts for making a [fantastic video on Autechre](https://youtu.be/ea3FP5NqUqM)	i hate music review videos.  its not like he's breaking down the bad logic of a movie plot, it's just a random dudes subjective music taste. maybe he was having a bad day, listened to one out of a million albums he had to get through for his reviews, etc. also, white noise isn't necessarily annoying.

A handful of a the really religious nutbags did hold a favorable view of him, but only because he was their guy in the white house, but even then "like" seems like too strong a word. Frankly, the man has the charisma of a single slice of stale white bread, not truly offensive unless you know his policies (in which case there's a lot of reasons to hate the fucker,) but also of interest to virtually no one.  Odds are good that if not for him refusing the attempted end run around the electoral process, most of the fuckers wouldn't even know his name.

gjshgxq	Insurance options	I second this recommendation, rather than the Rudi Hoffman one.	It's actually not that complicated at all. You just need an insurance agent that knows how to do it. You sign up for whole (recommended) or term and make it payable to the Cryonics Organization. I recommend adding a rider onto your policy for a nominal fee that will cover payments if you ever miss them. The insurance agent has to know how to do it, but there are lists of agents whom know how. See below.

And what about keeping Saric, or getting Galloway for almost nothing?  Remember how bad of a FA destination we are, and be lucky we have such a deep team, which is at least partly due to CP3.	It's way too early to make any definitive judgement, but the Suns could have kept Rubio, traded Oubre and signed Christian Wood or Jerami Grant and still have signed Jae Crowder. CP3 is great and I think the starters will get chemistry and this team will be amazing, but there are other paths this team could have taken that might have been better.

In America they see you as a product, so if you're willing to pay they will do what you want eventually.	Yeah the same thing happened to my best friend! She was FIFTEEN when they told her to just HAVE A BABY. They absolutely refuse to let her have a hysterectomy, even though she has been asking for one for five years. She doesn't want children, her PCOS has caused her so much pain, and she just keeps being told to be on the mirena, which has twisted and perforated and she has had to have them removed THREE TIMES, and reinserted... or told to have a fucking baby.  Edit: also from Australia, boy do we have some stories. Even the female doctors here don't take women seriously. They all gaslight, all tell you to see a psychologist and do yoga about it. Same friend had a three broken toes, it took THREE different doctors to find out they were broken because they all kept sending her away without doing X-rays or anything. It's a fucking nightmare being a woman and being sick.	Oh how I wish I qualified! I am in Australia.   My favourite story though (which MANY women around the world share!) is being told to "just have a baby" and it will fix my PCOS. I have heard this advice for endometriosis also. My multiple autoimmune diseases in addition to PCOS and other things is part of the reason I am childfree, I am in no position to care for a child.	No in Australia they simply will not do it unless you might die. Another friend of mine was 35 with four children and when she asked the doctor they said they would need her husbands permission before even discussing it!	0

gju4yhr	Why do far left groups use the Hammer and Sickle at their protests?	All good questions, but TBH, I'm cynical about our ideas getting any traction with the right regardless of symbols. The right has the drumbeat pounded into their heads on a daily basis that everything we do is Marxist/Maoist/Stalinist as it is.  I'm no fan of the catchphrase "defund the police" for the reasons you mention. However, I find the US hysteria over Communism, and the use of it as a catchphrase for anything they hate, to be so laughable that I think the more we shove it in their faces and force them to deal with the economic policies of communism vs the political policies of Soviets and authoritarians, the better.	Sure but leftists want to convince people to support their ideas, candidates and policies. How many of the people that they could convince - not conservatives that will only vote Republican and for the worst Republicans at that - but people they can convince will know about the history of the symbol?  Im vaguely aware of the symbols background and Im far more likely than the average American to support ideas from leftists and I still am repulsed when I see people marching with that symbol. Its almost an involuntary reaction to it.  If you are convincing someone to support you, why pick a logo that turns off most people you want to convince? Why pretend anyone is going to listen while you explain the origins of the symbol instead of talking about your policy instead?	Communism isn't the same as soviet patriotism? The symbol was used for communism outside of the USSR before they co-opted it.	I actually strongly dislike the argument you’re making here. I try to specify that I’m not saying you’re going to convince anybody on the right but maybe I should’ve been clear.  I constantly see people on the far left defaulting to “they say everything we want is Socialism therefore we should say whatever we want“ as an argument. If that’s the real argument, then all the leftist should just go home and spend their time doing something else because they can simply never win. They’re saying it themselves - They have no ability to change minds.  If people on the far left want to convince people to adopt their policies that they should assume that everybody who self identifies as a Republican will never come on board and look at the large section of people in between that can be convinced. Because those are the people who decide elections  And those people are completely and utterly repulsed by symbols like the hammer and sickle. Most of them find it almost as repulsive or nearly as repulsive as a Nazi swastika. The word Socialism invokes poverty and failed states and the word communism invokes totalitarianism, mass starvation and gulags.  I don’t have polling data on this because why would anyone bother polling on it, but I would bet real money and the overwhelming majority of people who voted for Bernie Sanders in the 2020 primary think the hammer and sickle on a flag at a protest is disgusting.	0

I highly recommend starting with Harvard's [CS50](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/) instead, it also teaches C at the beginning (well, after 1 lecture of Scratch) and they have their own web-based IDE.

This is abysmal, how are HP selling them direct and not getting them out to resellers? Surely this must be a breach of contract between HP & Resellers?!?	None	You know who also is not their focus, the pre-order and now CURRENT customers who waited for months and have dead headsets. Now they are waiting for replacement parts/headsets, while new customers are being served.  Just got my money refunded from Connection after pre-ordering in Sep 2020 and getting a dead headset in December.  **Good riddance**	0
gjuc2l2	How numbers are calculated in binary	That's the one.	Mission to Mars?	There was a countdown timer like this (I think in base-4) in a movie about Mars where they find a face starring Gary Sinese (sp?).  I *love* this animation.	None	0
gjucqfw	Could this meeting with an unknown Deloitte PPMD be a layoff?	This is probably the only reasonable response itt.	You can possibly call his assistant and ask whats the meeting about. They probably wont say anything if its a layoff but can tell you what its about if it is not a layoff so you can have a much less stressful week. Also pls update us	None	None	0
gjudsll	Does anyone play tennis or exercise to get rid of stress?	Swimming is great; you'll love it once you get over the hump your first week or two. You'll feel like shit at first, though.  Source: competitive swimmer.	I just want to know how one gets the stamina to exercise 3-4 hours a day.  And I definitely exercise to relieve stress. I run maybe 3 times a week. I told myself I want to start swimming maybe 2 times a week also, but I've been too lazy to start.	None	None	0
gjufe7b	As a send-off, here's every Donald Trump joke from the show.	Well done! Thanks for making it!	Hi, I made this video 4+ years ago, and it still bothers me that I missed 2 references:  1. In Segment 5 of 204-Catalina Caper, when reading a letter of a wedding invite, Crow says "It's the Trumps and its in New York."  2. In Segment 4 of 320-The Unearthly, Joel is reading the directions of the Bots' board game and says "Each player starts out with a billion dollars and half a dozen hotels, but immediately loses them when they dump Ivana for Marla."  My apologies.	None	None	0
gjugs4z	High-dose saccharin supplementation does not induce gut microbiota changes or glucose intolerance in healthy humans and mice (Jan 2021, n=23) - A follow up on studies in humans and rodents showing unfavorable changes in glucose homeostasis in response to Non-caloric artificial sweeteners	The Hadza eat tons of honey and have no disease.	Honey also contains fructose which is still inflammatory. And theres no fiber to modulate uptake.	What about pure honey? Does it's anti-microbial properties harm the microbiome?	I suspect that’s some hyperbole on the disease part. But I agree they are healthy and can probably afford to eat the treats alongside their healthy lifestyle. They still hunt in the wild and have a non-sedentary life, right?	0
