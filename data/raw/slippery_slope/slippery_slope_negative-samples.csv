fjj3g6r	Message of Cabin in the Woods: Fuck Off producers.	TIL! Thanks	As a director, producer and writer in the film industry. Your a bit off base as to what the producer`s role is. Keep in mind theres a bunch of different types of producers. What your describing is more of a studio rep sort of thing.	None	None	0
fjlw4ez	Message of Cabin in the Woods: Fuck Off producers.	I think you’re probably right but I think that’s a little inaccurate. I don’t think derivative films come because people demand them, but because studios know who their audience is and how to market to them. If a film doesn’t follow any conventions they’re won’t have the advantage of knowing how or who to market it to.  I like to think that the hand represented horror in general restless to break out and the producers are barely keep them satiated with these formulaic slasher conventions that’s keeps the operators in a great position.	Remember that the giant hand at the end, and the gods they make reference to during the film is the audience.  It's as much our fault as the studio execs.	None	None	0
fjpreq6	Actors you realized where in a movie/series you watched years ago or so, after rewatching it, or other circmumstances.	I feel like purse girl was the strangest because I feel like I saw her in the office and then two months later she was in every movie made since.	Also purse girl in the Office.  And just recently realized she's the nerdy assistant that Ricky Bobby ends up with in Talladega Nights.	Since you mentioned movies/***series***, I'd have to say rewatching the first season of *That 70's Show* and seeing Amy Adams pop up was pretty cool.   Also played a villain of the week in *Smallville*.	None	0

fjrbgjf	The London Assembly calls for all anon accounts and "hate" content to be banned	If your friend uploads their address book to facebook, they already have your phone number, they don't need you to give it to them.  A couple of years ago I had notification asking to confirm my number, my number was included in the notification. I personally have never given it, never uploaded my contacts, nothing. But there it was.	This is already pretty much the case though, Facebook has your IP, they had that over and then track down who you are via that. Other than using VPNs to hide that ofc. They typically do take your phone number when signing up these days.	What exactly is the extent of the law? I mean, I’m actually ok with ‘identified accounts’ so long as it’s a) only accessible for enforcement (foreign political advertising, bots, any ridiculously poisonous comments) and b) only for social media so you can have whistle-blowers do their thing anonymously.  I’d still be ‘pwns_ur_mums69’ to the common man, for the purposes of light trolling, but not invulnerable if I turn properly criminal.	No my point is most social media companies want your phone number before signing up.	0

Then when the Federal Reserve put money in to fix the crash, they complained about how the Federal Reserve is not being used for free college.	Many of them never had it. The few that were sensible are giving in quickly. Right now on r/politics they are beside themselves with joy because the economy has crashed and possibly eliminated Trump's gains.

My new partner was going through old photos on my laptop to see all my friends that she hasn’t met, it may have slipped my mind that I had multiple nude photos of all the girls I had slept with on there not hidden in any way, so after about 120 photos every so often she would come across some chicks naked selfie that they had sent to me.  We had only been dating for about three months  at this stage, she took it well laughed it off we have been together for 4 years now and she has outright refused to send me nudes the whole time!

fn2774t	Their time to shine!	Just curious- I'm guessing this varies but is the head covering supposed to cover the hair? Also are there feelings of "wrong priority" when a woman covers her full body apart from her face, but then wears makeup?	Muslim here... there's no problem with wearing a mask. Obviously, you can see that it's a man beneath the mask. Also, men can always wear face coverings, there's no problem with that.   The Niqab, the face covering that some women wear actually isn't a part of Islam, although many people, including Muslims, think it is. In the desert, Arab men and women used to wear a face covering to protect their faces from the sun and from sand. However, some women started wearing it all the time for modesty, and hence, the idea of Niqab was born. It isn't obligatory on women, it's optional for women if they want to wear it.	How do Muslim men feel about this? Since face coverings are associated with females.. Is it like a man being forced to wear a skirt?	None	0
fn7fw62	Bannerlord Caladrian Empire	Interesting! I love playing as the Byzantines in other games, trying to restore a dying empire is a challenge in and of itself. So I’m quite happy with it being based of the Eastern Roman Empire.	Its a situation based off of the Byzantine era of the Middle Ages. The Romans didn't have such advanced armor. Plus its the year 1084, the Roman part of the Roman empire was long gone. All that was left was the Greek Eastern Empire. That's also why all the names are Greek. Another reason why I know it's based off the Byzantines is because the Vlandans are based of of the Normans, which didn't exist while the Roman empire was still alive. The Capital of the Old Calradic Empire was Praven. Though it went by a different name	None	None	0

This sub is so funny.  The purpose of the FOIA request is to provide a basis for Pershing County to increase law enforcement, at least tripling it. The county would like to increase enforcement on playa pre- and post- the event and on the roads in and out.  That would allow more arrests and citations and give the county more ammunition to completely end the event which the current sheriff has argued for years.  In the EIS process, Pershing County requested the event be reduced to 50,000.

fnuswcn	Part of the reason why people become Furries is because of being bullied and having nowhere else to go.

We're supposed to believe self reported stats about "bullying" from dysfunctional people who feel compelled to publicly flaunt their fetish, while simultaneously trying to convince us that it's not a fetish? Nah. The reason this doesn't make sense is that it has zero connection to reality.	I see where youre coming from, but it simply doesnt make sense to me.

fo101dy	The Obamacare website cost $2.1 Billion to create	Seems like a lot to infer when all OP did was provide a link	It sounds like youre framing this as a negative aspect of Obamacare. Now, I wont pretend I know enough about Obamacare to argue one way or the other, I do have an opinion on it and reasons for that opinion, but Im not as knowledgeable as I could (or would like to) be.   But this fact doesnt really have much to do with the program itself, if that *is* what youre implying. This is criminal mismanagement, and youll find bloat just like it everywhere in the US government Im afraid to say. People that dont understand that that amount is so ludicrously beyond reason, or that are purposely giving their friends (or themselves) an extra large pay day. Still absolutely disgusting of course.	None	It’s more from their comments, actually. They’re pretty clearly trying to argue Obamacare is bad (which is fine, everyone can have an opinion), and using this as a piece of evidence to argue that.   That said, I’d say the title and post alone are enough to clearly infer that. The fact that it’s on “unpopular facts” means that the popular consensus is the opposite of the post. Clearly most people don’t know or care about the exact cost of the website, so what OP has to be going against is the idea that Obamacare in general is a good thing.  It’s a shit argument and doesn’t really fit the subreddit, since the fact itself isn’t really unpopular, nor specific to Obamacare, everyone thinks the government is wasteful and spends too much on shit, which this is just another example of. And it doesn’t really even have anything to do with Obamacare, either. The fact that one portion was criminally mismanaged doesn’t say anything good or bad about the premise itself.	0

I feel like they're hoping the good PR and the things people can do with these allowances will mean people will pay for them after...  ...but I hope it backfires on them. Because all of this bullshit is literally stuff they made up to increase their own profits. The way they have treated consumers, and even services such as streaming providers, is absolutely f\*ing criminal. I mean, cable companies like Comcast were basically running the tech equivalent of a protection racket when they extorted companies like Netflix, all while saying that net neutrality was hurting their ability to make profits.

That said, there's tons of stories of baristas getting coffee thrown at them, so it's sadly plausible	This is most likely fake, the way the girl is smiling the whole time is huge red flag.

fp9v9yn	My problem with Doctor Sleep as a sequel to the Shining...	I get that and honestly it felt it sort of suffered as a sequel because it still paid so much homage to the Kubrick film. They should’ve gone a different direction and not use the imagery set up by the first film. I think they tried to do the best of both worlds and it spoiled it a bit.	Ok i can explain this for you. The shining novel is very different from the film. Kubrick focused on psychodrama and thriller aspects where the novel was much more supernatural and scifi focused. The doctor sleep novel was very much an in line sequel to the shining novel. Also in kubrick's film he kills off a character that remains alive throughout the books and is an important part of doctor sleep. The problem is that for most audiences when they here "the shining" they think of the film and not the novel so making a sequel they had to balance honoring the visuals of the kubrick film and the theming of the original king novel.	None	They definitely wanted to cash in on the iconic status of the shining film. The shot where they reveal the hotel was a big moment.   In the books the hotel burns down at the end of The Shining and isn’t in Dr. Sleep at all.	0

They have over 50 million people in a small footprint.   Average age is also higher than Iowa which is tied to higher mortality. I have no agenda and dont support one way or the other for how we keep our citizens safe, but I repeat if you think the death total is lower you are CRAZY.	Let's not forget South Korea.

fpspodg	COVID-19 Update: IDPH reported 655 new positive cases and 12 deaths. That brings the statewide total to 11,059 cases and 231 deaths.	Care to elaborate? As someone with a non-medical background, ventilators seem like a useful thing to have when dealing with a respiratory illness. I guess I don't know understand the proper function of them.	Really doesnt matter to count ventilators.  They are the absolute worst thing to put COVID patients on anyway.	"There are currently 417 hospitalized with COVID-19, while 31 have been admitted in the last 24 hours. IDPH reported 151 patients in intensive care, while 107 are on ventilators.  IDPH reported 3,770 inpatient beds available, with 583 ICU beds available. There are 678 ventilators available."  This was the info I was looking for, we are climbing in percentage of ICU beds and ventilators being used. I believe the second line is total capacity state wide so we are using 107/678 ventilators. Someone can correct me if I am wrong.	The vast majority of covid-19 patients who are on ventilators die anyway, or suffer potentially permanent lung damage.   The twist is that there's increasing evidence that ventilators arent addressing the underlying issue for many patients, which is low blood oxygen; ventilators force the lungs to work mechanically (moving air in/out), but doctors are finding many patients lungs are capable of doing that on their own. Blood oxygen is the issue.   Ironically, its weeks spent on ventilators at high settings that may be causing some patients to have permanent damage, not the virus itself. And for the really bad patients, ventilators arent saving most of them.  Note that this doesnt mean the virus isnt the actually causing lung problems. It seems like microclots are emerging as the cause... not weakened lungs that a ventilator is supposed to help with. Clotting in lungs also supports the argument that the virus is affecting the blood, and sometimes that presents itself as low blood oxygen.  Plenty of sources out there but here's one: https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/21/coronavirus-analysis-recommends-less-reliance-on-ventilators/  > Starting this month, a few physicians have [voiced concern](https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/08/doctors-say-ventilators-overused-for-covid-19/) that some hospitals have been too quick to put Covid-19 patients on mechanical ventilators, that elderly patients in particular may have been harmed more than helped, and that less invasive breathing support, including simple oxygen-delivering nose prongs, might be safer and more effective.  It's funny... a doctor in NYC started talking about this in late March and people thought he was nuts, saying the virus presents more like high altitude sickness than pneumonia. Six weeks later, and treatments are starting to change.  TL;DR Ventilators can save some patients lives, but they arent a panacea and their importance has almost certainly been overstated.	0

fpv9h65	UK lockdown could be 'unpoliceable' next weekend, police warn	&gt; It probably should be balanced with the fact that if they were being paid to do that trip it would be "work which cannot be performed from home" and so fine to do.  So if you became a self-employed photographer/writer/blogger/youtuber or similar, you could potentially make 'business trips' to all those forbidden beauty spots?	A few days ago there was an article about two motorcyclists fined for travelling 200 miles (round trip) to buy fish and chips.  Morally correct? Maybe.  Legally correct? The law allows you to leave your house to buy essentials (food listed explicitly). It doesn't stipulate a distance. So quite possibly ok to do.  It probably should be balanced with the fact that if they were being *paid* to do that trip it would be "work which cannot be performed from home" and so fine to do.  There's been amazingly little discourse over the scope of these new powers.	It was never enforceable. I’d honestly be surprised if most fines *weren’t* cancelled for being wholly unlawful.	I've seen quite a few motoring YouTubers do exactly this in the past week. Now that it's becoming apparent that the fines given out won't stand up in court.	0
fpxdn8c	BoE warns UK set to enter worst recession for 300 years	The cold reality is that society can afford to lose 1% of the population far more than it can afford to lose 25% of the economy.  If society as we know it collapses entirely, the death toll could be far higher than the worst-case Covid outcomes.	Ending the lockdown will result in *more* deaths, not *less*. That is the official stance of the WHO.  Unless, of course, you know something that the top professionals at the WHO don't. In which case call them *immediately* and let them know.

fq326tq	Wedding planners, what is the weirdest couple you’ve ever met?	Since literally no one with an actual interest in BDSM will have anything to do with those fucking books, this is the most correct answer...	Well I guess we know what that couple was in to.  Bad literature!	Oooh! Not a wedding planner, but attended a wedding of this super-rich acquaintance.   It was a large venue to accommodate around 1500-2000 guests (pretty common in my culture). The theme for all wedding festivities was - don’t ask why - 50 Shades of Grey! Right from calling each other “My Mr. Grey” and “My Ms. Steele”. Right from masks to fans and colour themes, the entire place was decked up following that theme.  Not to mention, as you enter the venue, there was a pictorial depiction of their journey set to the same theme! I have some great memories explaining this to my super conservative parents!  Edit: Grammar	Yep. Every one I know in the bdsm community HATES those books.	0

fq3zcl7	Wedding planners, what is the weirdest couple you’ve ever met?	Glad your daughter got out of whatever the hell that was!	Our daughter's first marriage was to a pastor's son.  The father married them, but left right after the food was served because they did not believe in dancing or alcohol.  They hated our daughter because she "corrupted" their son (who was also a virgin when they married)  and when they divorced a couple of years later, the parents were mortified.  They didn't believe in divorce either.   She is much happier now.	I'm a chef for a caterer/event planner, US based. We coordinate everything for the couples (unless they choose not to). We always learn the crazy stuff about the couple direct from the person who has been meeting with them for months and is coordinating the night of. Or we saw it first hand if it happened at the wedding itself.   One couple got married in a gorgeous old venue. No alcohol (VERY odd), no music, no dancing. The couple had their actual first kiss after the vows.  They barely looked at each other the whole night. A waitstaff found the officiant's wife crying on the floor "not knowing if she could keep doing it". She pleaded for a drink, which we didn't have because it was a dry ceremony. Then she disappeared for a while. We think they might have all been in a cult. But that info wasn't relevant to the booking so we can't know.   Honestly that is just the first one that comes to mind. After seven years doing this you see some weird shit.	Us too!  Thank goodness there were no children (and that was another bone of contention with her in-laws).   They expected them to have a child within the first year.	0

fs2uq27	'Absolutely no legal authority': Trump's threats to shut down Twitter are 'totally asinine' and reek of censorship, according to legal experts	Which is why it reeks? Reek is a smell so awful and blatant that you can't ignore it.	They "reek of censorship"?  This is the most textbook case of a threat of government censorship that is even fucking possible.    Like seriously, if you put this episode into a textbook as an example of censorship, your editor would probably make you change it because it's too unrealistically simple and straightforward.  "The president would never threaten to shut down an entire company because it contradicted him, think a little harder about something people might actually come across in real life."	None	"reeks of" means "gives a strong impression of". It is not used to mean "is a clear example of" or "is".   This is a journalistic dodge, where you're meant to avoid directly accusing someone of something.

fsvr0aq	As a Destiny player, I miss not having a post master in division	If you got disconnected and the group was abandoned, the session was restarted entirely, I guess.

Nuh you can't. It's locked to sessions and wipes in missions. I crashed at a boss who dropped an exotic, when I got back I loaded in outside the mission (sames session) everyone left, I solo heroic'd the missions again and no loot was there at all  It USED to stay in the game for ages in TD1 like you say though	You can just pick the stuff up in the next run. When only the mission is restarted (no change of world dufgiculty or leaving group), all drops stay in the spots they were before restart. It's really funny how much stuff is scattered through the mission area when xou've done six speed runs without picking up anything for the leagues.  In God of War you can collect the stuff you missed to pick up from the Shops of the blacksmiths. Which is basically the same concept as Destiny.	> If you got disconnected and the group was abandoned, the session was restarted entirely,  Nuh, I got back in with the session owner idling in the boss area, as I went to fast travel on him he left, so I stayed in his session to run it again, same difficulty, sessions etc, because obviously in TD1 loot stayed :(	0

He doesnt look in great shape, either.  I think the nicest thing you can do for him is leave him to live out his days in your backyard (ie look, but definitely dont touch).	None	Sure! Slightly different proportions than a domesticated rat (smaller eyes and ears, shorter head, a couple other small things).  He’s the color virtually all wild rats are, though pet rats can be this color, too.    His tail is pretty gross, which means he’s probably old/ill/injured and can’t clean it properly.  Poor guy.

Slavers fucking used the Bible to justify slavery. America used the Bible to justify westward expansion and the Trail of Tears.   What mass sufferings, other than pandemics, *haven’t* been in the name of religion?   I’m not saying religion is bad, because most religious people I meet are visibly good people, but the amount of people who contort it to fit their beliefs is alarming.

We are all going to eventually die so what’s wrong with exposing people to cancer causing chemicals?   This is a poor argument.	Ive never heard of this question before. This is quite interesting.   I figured that technically we have all been created to eventually die, so whats so different about trying for a baby that would risk dying.	None	There’s more to it than just this, if a person is already in a dying state, it’s not wrong to give them a chance to continue even if it’s just 2%, it’s worth a shot.

fvrdszo	Chief of Police supports potential vehicular manslaughter	I'm missing the connection between 2017 Senate File 111 and a Police Chief encouraging the use of vehicles to run over civilians.  That act would make it a violation to block the movement of traffic on highways with a posted speed limit of 55+ mph. That video was from the Hy-Vee in Park Ave, not a 55 mph hwy, so even if 2017 Senate File 111 was passed, it doesn't seem pertinent here.	We should have passed 2017 Senate File 111.  It would have made blocking a highway a Class D felony.  *If standing in a road is a felony, then if you're hit while standing in a road, not only does the driver's insurance company owe you nothing, the company can sue your estate for the damages to the car.*	Sadly in that part of Iowa the people won’t see anything wrong with what he’s saying.	> it doesn't seem pertinent here  Strictly speaking that is correct.  However if it was on the books it would be pretty easy to amend it to apply to more situations.

fw6srew	Found this on a post regarding bidens current lead in the polls.	Wow, that is ..... just wow. I guess at 21 he assumes you get a shit plan because you dont need it? But 21 year old get sick and injured too.	Trump:  > So preexisting conditions are a tough deal. Because you are basically saying from the moment the insurance, you're 21 years old, you start working and you're paying $12 a year for insurance, and by the time you're 70, you get a nice plan. Heres something where you walk up and say, 'I want my insurance.' Its a very tough deal, but it is something that were doing a good job of.  [source](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-health-insurance-cost-new-york-times-interview-2017-7)  At the time we assumed he was getting health insurance confused with term life insurance you see commercials for on fox - such as Gerber Life.	He thought insurance was only $12/yr? I knew about most of these but that one is new.	Do American children NOT receive several million dollars from their dad when they turn 21? I would think that much money would help young people afford insurance and medical costs, especially when insurance is only $12 per year.  And lastly—just don’t get sick or injured. You know, all the sickness and injuries you plan on sustaining throughout this year... just stop it. Stop it. Cut it out. It’s costing the nation mil— billi— hundreds of trillions of dollars!	0

fwwph3w	Authorities in India’s north-eastern state of Nagaland have banned the sale of dog meat and halted the import and trading of dogs to be used for food, said officials.	Can only pray they extend it to other animals too. :)	From article:  Animal rights advocacy group Humane Society International said in a statement: This is a major turning point in ending the cruelty in Indias hidden dog meat trade.  The group estimates up to 30,000 dogs a year are smuggled into Nagaland, where they are sold in live markets. The group said dogs are also regularly beaten to death with wooden clubs.  Authorities praised the movement to ban the trade. This is a progressive move. In this day and age, positive social media activism and advocacy has an enormous impact on policymakers.

Same reason we don't generally eat cats, horses, and mules. Pigs are smart, but realistically unable to perform jobs like other animals.  Edit: This is from a US perspective.

And like a line in the sand, it's impermanent and changes with the tide.  There's no real reason for it, beyond it being, "how things have always been done." Cultural inertia is the only justification most people need.	Well at what point do you stop? Is there a line in the sand we dont cross? Or is everything fair game?   Why not pandas, why not all endangered species? Eventually we as a society draw lines in the sand and rule out certain practices. This is one of those things.   The argument being, as a collective we have decided eating a human bred purely for companionship/working is past that line.   This applies to many things we have now as a society agree are wrong, despite really not justified from a evolutionary perspective.	What’s the argument for eating chickens, pigs, cows, ducks, et al but not dogs?	I think at the core of it. As humans we can find certain things generally repugnant. Canabilsm for instance and I believe the eating of dog meat pulls those same feelings as we have such close affinity with dogs globally. Sure exceptions exist but very true in the western world.	0

g288rug	What simple “life hack” should everyone know?	I know people will say "just be nice to everyone", but really: receptionists and admins run the office. And none of them work in isolation - they have a shadow network built where everything gets done.  So beyond getting hired, once you start working there you will *need* them to survive.  You need to book a meeting last minute and can't find a conference room? You need a meeting catered? You messed up your reimbursement form and need the VPs signature to fix it? You need 500 copies of a presentation printed in 1 hour? You cannot find a hotel that meets the trav criteria in whatever bumfuck town you need to go to?  A lot of corporate America is dealing with red tape. Admins and receptionists carry really sharp scissors. So if you want to get things done fast, get on their good side.  Mind you - it doesn't take much. You don't need to be a suck up, you just need to do a couple of things:  1. Don't act like they work for you. Act like they are your coworker, and recognize that in some capacities they outrank you.  2. Treat them as part of the team, not as some third party that takes care of stuff you don't care about. They normally care about the teams they work with, and it's appropriate to recognize their contributions to the team's success.  3. Be pleasent to them.	>Manners and general politeness will get you far  I'll add to this... Be especially nice to receptionists. They are the gate keepers. Whether you're there to interview for a job or attempt to sell something to the owners, if you are rude to the receptionist, you can kiss your chances goodbye.

The process costs money, takes time, and not everyone will be approved.   Its a competition, not a lottery. Applicants will be competing with a few million other people from all over the world. Canada selects applicants who have a 4 year University degree with at least 5 years of actual employment experience OR certified skilled trades people, with employment in their trade.   Jimb.

g5a34ct	Israeli handed 3 life sentences for killing Palestinian family	It’s more a nationalist thing. Since the ark is gone and the holy temple was destroyed by the Romans. There is no unifying body that has authority over the rest of the Jewish people, in a religious context. Each Jew can interpret the Torah how ever they please. Or at least that’s how it should work, but a few extreme orthodox communities disagree.	Don't think Israel is all that religious, its more a nationalist/ethnic thing for Israel.   This is also partially true for the Islamic nations, religion plays a big factor, but they get into squabbles over non religion too.	They usually get away with their crimes because they are religious? So happy that this fanatic arsehole will be in jail for a long time!	None	0

It's psychological torture to the people wearing masks for idiots to trot around coughing on people and spitting on people during a deadly pandemic.	Psychological torture is just now. Gotta love it.	Forced labor? It's a punishment for a crime.	0

The MAX is inherently flight-unstable, which is why MCAS was added in the first place.   I would not be surprised if it is grounded permanently. In fact, thats probably the best outcome.	Europe and iirc Canada both do their own re-certicfication right now. That is very unusual and a sign of lost trust in the FAA.  On the bright side: It adds some security, if the MAX gets recertified by them all. Some.	None	0

g6bh6pk	Hiring Managers, what is the biggest red flag on a Resume?	Because someone that is advancing that fast is unlikely to advance at that rate permanently. If they've been at each job for 1 year and gotten good enough to warrant an external promotion, then it means they're really good at thir job.  However, they're not going to become Director, VP, SVP, and CEO in the next 4 years. So you're banking on two things:  1. That you're hiring them at the right level 2. That if they exceed expectations, you'll be willing and able to promote them when they deserve to, not when it's convenient for your company.  The reason that people move jobs frequently when they're able to get promotions is normally because companies are too slow to promote. That's not an indictment on the candidate, but in the company they worked for.  So sure, if you are a hiring manager at a company who lowballs and doesn't promote people when they should, don't hire job hoppers.	Even if they are moving on to better jobs, why would you want to hire them? Presumably you'll just be another stepping stone which they'll leave as soon as they get a better offer. Hardly seems worth the time of bringing them on board.	A bunch of short, equivalent level jobs.  I don't mind job hoppers if they're hopping for better jobs. Like, if someone went from Analyst, to Sr. Analyst, to Manager, to Manager at a bigger company and those were all short stints, I'm not holding it against that person.  But if they went from Analyst to Analyst to Business Analyst, to Sr. Analyst at a smaller company... that's a big red flag.	Does everyone at your company get a promotion every year whether it's convenient for the company or not? That seems completely unreasonable and unsustainable.  Someone who moves up in the same company impresses me. But job titles between companies don't always signify a promotion. Different places throw titles around. And you don't know whether he jumped ship because he was a rock star, or failed at that job, but was able to find a better job based solely on his new title.  Bottom line, anyone who is good at their job can always find a better job for more money, more responsibility, et cetera. I've given people a promotion and a huge raise and they've left two months later for even more money. You can't keep good people with money. They have to want to stay.	0
g6d8jnv	Why should I, as woman and rape victim be pro-life?	Imagine claiming that the definition of human rights and laws aren’t created by people’s opinions.	With all due respect, your opinion does not matter since legality and human rights are not opinion based stuff.  If someone deserves RTL, its not for another someone to strip.  Fetuses are biologically human, are a human life, the only group who are legal to kill.  There isn't any other atteibute that allows it, outside of age.  For you, personally: Since it is an opinion based thing, its hard to go to the other side. But I recommend reading about bioethics and human development after conception.   a life is a life no matter how small - Dr. Seuss	None	That is true, but why the fetus is not a person interpretation has to be law?	0
g6juki3	CMV: Cigarette Company CEOs are murderers	Opiods dealers are criminal because what they sale is outlawed, i.e. It is illegal to sell.  We think heroin is much more dangerous than cigarettes, mainly, heroin addictions prevents you to function and that happens fairly quickly. You can live all your life with a cigarette addiction and be fine up until the point you get sick.  Hence, cigarettes are not unlawful.	Great questions.  I would argue that the semi-recent CEOs (from when scientists first knew smoking was killing people) are liable.   We know opiods, heroin etc. are addictive, that wouldnt make the dealer any less of a criminal.  We dont say ok everyone knows heroin is addictive so the dealer cant be held liable.   The CEO is dealing a harmful drug that has a 67% fatality rate.   Great question about the alcohol. Im no expert but I believe (I may be completely wrong) nicotine is a chemical addiction whilst alcohol is behavioural.  Edit: I am wrong about alcohol as others have clarified. This is a great point, maybe alcohol company CEOs should be liable too. I would argue though that smoking affects more than just the user. Unborn babies, children, other people around the user are being harmed by secondhand smoke.	The issue is personal choice.  Previously, when the public was unaware of the dangerous nature of the product, you may have been right... Are you distinguishing between historical cigarette CEOs or current ones?  As long as people are aware that cigarettes are dangerous (which it seems like every single person who smokes should be now that the adds are biased everywhere and every single package has a surgeon general’s a warning) they are making a conscious decision to do something monumentally stupid assuming that they are somehow immune from it.    Also, if the standard is selling a product that is unhealthy (I agree that they cause cancer and birth defects and are terrible), does that extend to alcohol?   Alcohol is not considered to be as bad as cigarettes, but it still causes tremendous health problems, birth defects and is addictive?	It's actually more the lifestyle of heroin use that causes health problems for the user, mostly to do with financial aspects and association with the kinds of people necessary to buy it   If it were supplied in a reliable, clean dose, that didn't cost so much the user had other parts of their life suffer (can't afford medical care, a place to live, clothes, good food etc), the problems would be FAR less. We know this because this is what actually happens - various places in the world allow for heroin to be supplied as a maintenance treatment. Similarly, those places with less strict drug laws tend to have significantly fewer problems with drugs (not always, but it's a strong trend)	0

If you can't tell the difference between a joke, and an ACTUAL celebration due to someone's death, the problem is you and not the joke.  "Well how do you know this is a joke?"  Because the scene is from a sit-com, and it's on a meme-themed subreddit.  You can't get more smoking guns into the room.  It's a joke, not a dick.  Don't take it so hard.

When I pointed out beans are bought in the can because dried beans require hours of soaking and a long time cooking he decided he would just eat them dried.  Of course I didn't know enough about beans to adequately explain why this was a bad idea, I just knew just that it was, so he ignored me.

Trump is directly benefitting from a process the religious zealot would never allow - if they had their way.

g8ara0v	A child has no exception to justice	What do you mean bullying is learned? Where did the first bully ever learn it from?	I always believe that kids act a certain way is through learned behaviour. Be it from the parents, the friends, or even from the media they consume. As much as it's easy to just blame the kid, a big part of it is external. I grew up with my dad slapping the shit out of me for both little and big mistakes and yes I grew up to be a decent person but also with the growth I bring emotional and psychological scars. I don't mean to say to follow a non-punishing route, just a non-violent one. Punish the kid all you want but if you want your kid to grow up being deathly afraid of affection from people and waking up screaming in the night, then by all means, slap the kid.  A kid's a bully not because it's natural, it's because it's learned.  Just my two cents.  Keep safe.	None	None	0

The Czech language was largely wiped out following the Battle of White Mountain, not being allowed in high society, schools, church, etc. Books written in the language were burned by the Austrian Hapsburg dynasty. It had essentially become a means of communication between the lower class, the vast majority of whom were illiterate.  Then the nationalist Czech National Revival movement happened in the early 1800's. It aimed to restore the Czech language and as a result the Czech language ended up either borrowing words from other Slavic languages or just sorta making their own words up.  It's a pretty far leap to say that the Czech language is fake, but I can see why they think that.	Who is it exactly that the Czech have colonized? Themselves?And how is Czech a fake language?	None	0

I even defend and like the Rob Zombie Halloween 2, for how subversively it goes against any really strict preciousness to the lore.

Chicago instead artificially capped the height of its buildings for a while for fear of the buildings blocking sunlight and creating wind tunnels.  680 Lakeshore isn't really a good example of the setback structure anyway since its mostly a rectangular structure with a spire.  Based on what i found, its not clear that the blue tower itself was intended for zeppelin mooring, but there was a mooring structure built on top of the building for sure - https://www.680lsd.com/history	Airship mooring!?   Urban legend.    These towers are all an artifact of the zoning code that allowed towers with appropriate setbacks to exceed the maximum building height of the time.	My dad's practice was on the first floor facing the lake for 25 years.. 18 foot floor to ceiling windows facing the lake. Such a nice building.  Edit: fun fact -- used to be 666. Was changed to 680 in 1984.  Other edit: The blue cupola and structure underneath was an airship mooring as it was the tallest building for a short time -- but it never actually got used for that.

gdc5p66	CMV: It makes no sense to ever refuse a police officer asking for identification	They should have a good reason, I agree. But you are not entitled to agree or debate whether the reason is good enough on the spot and deny them id. That is eventually a matter for court/discipline board later on.	The freedom to go about your business unhindered by the state (or anybody else for that matter) is one of the basic freedoms that everybody should be able to enjoy. Police should have to have a good reason for stopping and ID'ing a person. I don't see why the state or its agents ought to have the right to identify you if you aren't doing anything that necessitates that.	None	>That is eventually a matter for court/discipline board later on.   We both know that cops will literally never be disciplined for abusing that power. Moreover, what do you mean you don't have the right to debate it? Of course you can debate it. What, are the cops precious feelings going to be hurt when you tell them to fuck off and come back with probable cause? You can't be arrested on charges of 'thinking you shouldn't have been arrested'	0
gdc5u48	CMV: It makes no sense to ever refuse a police officer asking for identification	Well...ever in a legal sense. Of course if your goal is to avoid being identified, then sure. But indeed, not allowing legally to refuse id is done precisely to not give an out to those who'd like to avoid identification.	> It makes no sense to ever refuse a police officer asking for identification   If you know you're being sought by the police and your ID will enable them to identify who you are, then it makes lots of sense not to provide identification to the police. 'Ever' is a long time.	None	None	0
gdc655z	CMV: It makes no sense to ever refuse a police officer asking for identification	But you as a citizen are not in a position to know why the cop is asking you id. Maybe is racist. Maybe is just doing a routine check in that street and you are the one that happens to be there. Maybe you match a suspect description because of the hat you wear. You can never possibly tell.  Indeed, if the cop has bad behavior /discriminates, then he should be stopped/punished but that is a matter for courts/laws/discipline boards or whatever. Not for you on the street in the moment when id is asked to you?	If I'm a racist cop, is it okay for me to stop every black person I see and ask them for ID, while ignoring anyone that doesn't look black?  If a cop is doing that, and you're a black person, should you give them your ID?  The problem isn't that giving a cop ID automatically leads to your arrest, it's that it makes it much harder for cops to act in a racist manner and get away with it if everyone just complies with their every demand regardless of how unlawful that demand is.  If the cops are doing illegal things, we shouldn't let them control us. That leads to some really bad shit.	None	So you're saying that people should allow cops to just indiscriminately abuse their power until some other person in a position of power stops them, rather than directly fighting back against their abuse?  Cops aren't allowed to force you to do things without reason. So you can ask them if they're detaining you or if you're free to go. And if they have reasonable suspicion that you've committed a crime (the only legitimate reason they would have for asking you for ID), then they would tell you that they're detaining you and they would have to tell you what crime you're being detained for. If they don't have a reason to detain you, then they can't require you to provide them ID.  Why would you let a cop intrude on your rights illegally, when you could simply refuse to provide ID? If any other private citizen illegally tries to force you to do something that would intrude on your rights, you also wouldn't listen to them either, right?	0
gdcggwl	CMV: It makes no sense to ever refuse a police officer asking for identification	They need to justify what the do -- but to society at large, not specifically to you at the time, in the sense that they should be accountable for their actions and their use of force/infringing on rights. Otherwise, as they surround a bank being robbed, they should convince the robbers that indeed they are in the right in shooting them beforehand.	Why does a person need to prove their identity if they have done nothing wrong? Surely this is an arbitrary and abusable use of authority. It effectively turns everyone who doesn't carry ID into a criminal and allows the police to manufacture crime where there is none.  EDIT: Your logic is also the reverse of how policing works. Police need to justify **why** they should have a particular power over citizens. Instead, you state that citizens should justify why police *shouldn't* have this power. We are not obligate to answer this question, only to follow what is written as law. If expanding police powers worked this way, then there could be potentially no limit to what they could do.	None	You're comparing criminals committing a blatant crime in progress (bank robbery) to non-criminals exercising their rights and not wishing to be harassed (walking/driving around). Does this seem right to you? You are arguing from a stance that the citizen is a criminal, when the premise of your argument does not.  Regardless, you are still asking people to submit to unlawful, arbitrary and unnecessary policing measures, even if it is against their will. It informally legitimises police who are using social pressure and obfuscation to prevent people exercising their rights. It is quite obviously abusing authority and doesn't change the fact that they should justify it legitimately to, as you say, "society at large" before they ever should assume that regular citizens *have* to abide by it, which they haven't done in many places.  Also, communicating effectively with citizens, suspects and criminals is actually a good thing for police to do.	0
gdcgzez	CMV: It makes no sense to ever refuse a police officer asking for identification	That has to do with the fact that police should be accountable for what they do. Indeed - they should be held accountable and even more so than normal citizens. That they should be accountable does not mean they should be accountable \*to you\* while they perform your duties: they are accountable to their superior, to the law and to society at large.	That works in a world where the authorities can always be trusted. The reality is that police are people and they can abuse information they receive. So, they should be required to justify anything they request. It could become a practice to harass people by repeatedly asking them to produce ID. What happens if someone doesn't have ID on them? If there is more delay for the innocent party, then this could further allow them to delay someone under this ID pretense.	None	None	0
gdchc3w	CMV: It makes no sense to ever refuse a police officer asking for identification	With probable cause. But probable cause cannot be verified on the spot by the person whose ID is being asked, more likely by a judge later on.	\> It should be lawful (and in many place is) for police to ask you for id and arrest you if you refuse until they establish who you are. Change my view.   without probable cause?	None	You know not everyone can afford to go through with the legal process, right?	0
gdckmzi	CMV: It makes no sense to ever refuse a police officer asking for identification	And that would prevent them to perform their duty (the most banal case: they think you match a suspect and they would like to know if it is indeed you).  It is not a question of whether they should have a good reason to intervene, they should. It is a question of whether they have to prove to you at the time that they have it. If they have probable cause (they hear a pop sound and think it's a shot being fire) they can just enter on private property without explaining to you the why - at the time. In the same way I think they should have a good reason to stop and ask for id, but I don't think they should prove to you at the time of asking they do have a good reason, albeit they should be accountable for it and should be sanctionable after the fact if they asked outside of their purview	This is just a graduation of if you have nothing to hide then you have nothing to worry about. And to that I say wrong. We have the right to not be uselessly bothered by police. I could take your argument a little further and lets say police want to come into your home and look around. Why not just say yes, especially if you dont have anything to hide? Because on principle, we should not have to bend over for police for no reason.   > Clearly, police should be able to stop and identify people without them agreeing that stopping and identifying them is a good idea  Why? If they have probable cause, then arrest or detain them. Why bother with asking for an ID?  > or they would never stop and id anyone ever.  And?	None	> And that would prevent them to perform their duty  When does their duty require them to ask a random person for their ID? If they suspect of you committing a crime, then they can stop you for *that*. That’s called [probable cause.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probable_cause8)  > the most banal case: they think you match a suspect and they would like to know if it is indeed you  That’s just not how things work in a just society. And it really isn’t hard at all to imagine how that can be easily abused. That’s a free pass for cops to accost anyone they want. “He looked like a suspect.”  > but I don't think they should prove to you at the time of asking they do have a good reason  The only time they can disregard probable cause is when referencing probable cause could put someone’s life in danger. How could someone’s life be at risk but for a cop requiring random people’s ID’s?	0

gdg60m2	PROOF: Medicare for All didn't cost Dems seats in congress	Exactly. There's often this idea that winning areas won because of idea X, which simply isn't proven out by any evidence.  In order to demonstrate that idea X was a major factor in people's decision to vote for candidate Y, you can't simply point to the fact that candidate Y got elected, as there may be many other more important factors to that candidate that caused people to vote for them.	On the defund the police point:  That was a pretty naive analysis on whether defund the police actually lost seats. These sorts of claims require analysis that is more complex then that. Some basic ways to START showing correlation would be by seeing which seats of congress were FLIPPED, and asking voters in those districts what their perception of the DNC's ideas of the police were. Not every voter has all knowing knowledge, and when we have a president blatantly lying to the people saying "Biden supports defunding the police," then looking at solely one person running misses the point of the analysis. What matters here is not the policy of the person running, it is the perception of the politician AND the party they belong to.	None	None	0
gdg693n	PROOF: Medicare for All didn't cost Dems seats in congress	&gt; A leader must stop listening sometimes to do what’s right  Wrong. A leader must *educate* and *inspire*.

Dismantle the propaganda pipeline via a renewed Fairness Doctrine or simply attack their advertisers and payment platforms until they have literally no recourse.  Deplatforming and reeducation is the answer, not authoritarianism.	People must stop acting like politics is a science. We are in an age of extreme disinformation. None of the rules apply.  For progressive politics to work, the president must be willing to drag the country into the 21st century. Give the people healthcare. Give them minimum wage. Give them basic income.  For every policy the people bitch about, they wont let their next elected politician dismantle everything. Look at Trumps reaction when he won the office and was going to take down the ACA and his constituents said no just take down Obamacare.  Help the uneducated by providing for them. A leader must stop listening sometimes to do whats right. That is the point of progress.	None	Sometimes you have to educate people by giving them what they actually need regardless of their wants.

gg1s6xv	Dave Meltzer: "AEW last week beat all three hours of Raw last night in key demo, set its record in VPH and was first in both that and youngest skewing sports audience of the week. We had pegged that next summer at the earliest and only with WWE not turning it around or else no chance."	Here's my thinking. Wrestling in a lot of ways is timeless, and there are things that have worked since it's inception through today. But then there are certain sensibilities, trends, aesthetics that require fresh eyes and younger minds. Since everything has to filter through Vince and people he trusts (i.e. other old fucks that have similar sensibilities), WWE is not going to appeal to that younger demo. I know that WWE won't be going out of business anytime soon (nor would that be good for anyone), but it does not bode well that they mainly appeal to an aging demographic and may be shooting themselves in the foot in the long term when it finally comes time for the younger McMahons to inherit the company.	It is starting to feel like the younger fans are giving up on WWE and instead watching the newer, fresher product.  Can't say that I blame them.  This is exactly what happened with ECW until the nWo got hot, then the eventual shift once the Attitude Era took off.  If AEW continues to lock down the younger audience, they'll keep climbing.  The older audience does migrate, but it takes longer.  WWE is clinging to their older audience, losing their younger audience, and I don't see anything that can turn that ship around right now.

ggeg599	Mike Chioda: "You're tied down at WWE and you couldn't get royalties off of Video Games because they wouldn't let us in the Video Games. They let me in for a little while, and then once I was talking about, 'Okay, where's my royalties?' They took me right out of the game."	WWE was great at having a ton of personality at every level, from Heenan and Gorilla at commentary to Mean Gene holding it down backstage. It made everything you saw entertaining, and there was much more of a "thank you for welcoming us into your home, thanks for watching" vibe. Everyone had a name, everyone was important. It's a shame so many of the presentation issues WWE has come down to "Vince doesn't like it."	I never got that. I get it's wrestling and not a "real sport" but it's still presented as one and referees are pretty much always named in sports because they are an important part.  That goes double for wrestling where on top of doing the kayfabe referee stuff, they also do time cues, have occasional spots (ref bumps, being distracted), check on the wrestlers to see if they are legit hurt, etc. They deserve to be named and it's a minor thing that adds to the sports feel imo.	I remember reading a couple of years ago, Vince demanded the commentary team not to mention the referees by name anymore. All of this while he made the referees famous in the first place with all the storylines during the attitude era.	So true. Now it feels like Vince telling you to fuck off if you don't like the garbage he's showing you.	0

They let me in for a little while, and then once I was talking about, 'Okay, where's my royalties?' They took me right out of the game."	The only thing they get from me are pennies from ad revenue on UUDD videos. Otherwise I'm in the same boat. There are so many workers I'd like to support and watch in WWE, but there's just a pile of shit behind the scenes issues that keep me away.	I know Im the millionth person adding to the unoriginal pile, but man, I wish I could support the wrestlers that I like in the WWE but I refuse to give them another view or dollar. If they were actually receptive to change, then that would be different but they only double down. I stopped my network subscription with the Saudi deal even though I love going back to old stuff and the 24 documentaries, and stopped watching anything of theirs after the Cameo stuff.

I adore the movie, I really should get started on the books.	Trepanning is a recurring theme in Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin series of books.  If you happen to be spending the next year in lockdown or something like that you could do worse than read this series.  There is such a thing as a depressed skull fracture in which the skull is dented and pieces of bone are obviously protruding into the brain--a condition known to be not good, even in 1805.    So the trepane would come out, to the fascination of all.  As a nice added touch, someone always has to contribute a silver dollar, which is hammered into a dome-shape to replace the removed section of skull.	None	Yeah, for sure start with the one called Master and Commander.  The film borrows heavily from that in some highly relevant ways, and also another deeeep in the series, not coincidentally called The Far Side of the World.    But in between the two are something like a dozen heavily researched works that touch on that era's naval warfare, spycraft, exotic animals, popular music, historical personalities, prolific substance abuse, death and murder in almost every imaginable form, and toasted cheese.  Each one written in an effortless fictional prose worthy of Conrad or a Bronte sister.  And I swear that they get better through the series, too.  Really, the gift that lasts a lifetime.	0

I kinda hoped for Lucario to fulfill a similar role of having amazing coverage, at least maybe in UU or RU instead of a sad placement in NUBL. Having options for both physical and special could cause issues before its set is revealed and with the option of 3 strong physical priority moves it could just use band or SD and wallbreak. Either way I agree it's not winning in OU anytime soon but seeing it fall from OU to gen 5-7 UU to NUBL now is kind of sad to see	Nothing can save Lucario from base 90 speed. Its movepool is already fantastic and it packs a good amount of power, it just cant outrun everything that it needs to be able to win games in OU	None	Nido threatens way more mons bc it has more power on coverage moves. Lucario has to run STABs and then pick two of a boosting move, Espeed/Vacumn Wave, EQ, or dark coverage.	0

giiq8ik	DE Please add an FPS mode, even if it's a janky implementation.	&gt; It wouldn't work for the masses  Yes, let them put a phenomenal amount of work into implementing something that most people would never use, and that most of the people who do use it will only use briefly and switch back once the gimmick wears off.  It has always been a shit idea, and it always will be a shit idea.	Honestly I beg to differ. It wouldn't work for the masses, but I'm sure many players could find it fun and still be able to do parkour and the like. There could even be a shortcut key to toggle it, and it would be nice for exploring; not just to play missions necessarily.  I've spent some time, back when everyone used Carrier, forced into first person from too many items floating by the Carrier. It was janky, obviously, but it felt pretty good. Certain actions that are awkward in first person could just force you into third person for the animation.  What would also work really well is if you can separate it from your each type of character, so say you could toggle 3rd person for your Warframe, Archwing, and K-Drive, but 1st person for your Operator, Nechramech, ect. It would give players more immersion or even just a fresh way to experience the game.  Ofcourse it would take some dev time and polishing, but so does any feature.	I don’t think warframe would work with an fps mode because of how fast you move and how much is happening on the screen	None	0
giiy8bb	Teaching isn't that hard	But what I mean is that the sense of "Being a teacher is impossibly difficult" might be bleeding from the US to the UK. As an example:  &gt;Working through holidays and weekends? Again, those holidays are for the children, not adults. And I refuse to accept you cannot manage your workload properly as to get some time off during those lengthy holidays.  Are you certain that the teachers you're hearing from on this issue are strictly from the UK, not the US?	Yes I don't know much about the US education system but what little I do know is it is much harder for a plethora of reasons. My point is very much focused on the UK.	I feel like you're probably getting your general sense of opinion for how difficult it is from the US, where much of this isn't true	Oh yeah definetely from the UK. I worked in a school alongside teachers before I entered journalism (I myself was not a teacher granted). Also, I know a lot of teachers who complain about these things. Complaining is fine - I moan about my job sometimes we all do it. But I see a lot of social media attention (again from UK teachers I know) about how we should adore teachers due to the difficulties they face and I just don't buy it.	0

A different form of simplifications that are not being constantly revised would be the law classes in college.   Please read the first sentence, understand that I didn't actually care for the reasons, and reply, thank you! I value your opinions and thoughts very much, and would like to get an actual response.	>then why haven't we been able to simplify such complex ideas?  What? What do you mean? What form does that take?  "The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell" is that not a simplification of a complex idea?	Have you perhaps studied Law? or perhaps literature in high school? or any other subject that can be improved? There's tons of fields you haven't noticed being revised? Do you want to know why? It's because how would you know if they are or aren't revised? Who the f is going to revise them when we literally study the same bs and even build on it.  I mean I understand the other guy's POV of "It's not their job" but I'm sure that there are subjects that haven't been revised.  I mean, in history we didn't revise a lot within the scientific field. I don't think we should stop revising because it doesn't help with understanding much.	0

gikm0t3	Vaccine rollout hits snag as health workers balk at shots	While the guy is an idiot, your comment is no better. If you stopped for even a moment to think about what he's saying and the context, you'd realize that he's saying he wants to wait until April because he believes there should be a sufficient amount of data by that point in time to make an informed decision on the safety of recieving the vaccine.	So that just stops being a concern come April ? K	"Oregon doctor Noble said he will wait until April or May to get the shots. He said it is vital for public health authorities not to overstate what they know about the vaccines. That is particularly important, he said, for Black people like him who are distrustful of government medical guidance because of past failures and abuses, such as the infamous Tuskegee experiment." **That's a bingo!**	No, by April you will have 4 months of additional data about short term side effects. We already have that. The trials were large, dude is a doctor but is acting on emotion. If he said he would take it in 2-3 years when long term side effects can be studied I’d think him less of an idiot. Saying he’d take it in April makes him absolutely stupid.	0

gipgsru	South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, says that they are willing to share their lessons from its peaceful transition to democracy with the US.	&gt;Necklacing was used by the black community to punish its members who were perceived as collaborators with the apartheid government.[2] Necklacing was primarily used on black police informants; the practice was often carried out in the name of the struggle, although the executive body of the African National Congress (ANC), the most broadly supported South African opposition movement, condemned it.[3][4] In 1986, Winnie Mandela, then-wife of the imprisoned Nelson Mandela, stated, "With our boxes of matches, and our necklaces, we shall liberate this country", which was widely seen as an explicit endorsement of necklacing.[5][6] This caused the ANC to initially distance itself from her,[7] although she later took on a number of official positions within the party.	When Mandela became president they did not seek revenge and kill all the white people. That is what he means by peaceful. They had every reason to be angry.	He has got to be trolling. SA has huge problems with democracy, rule of law and climate change related issues.  Edit: there wasn't peaceful transition to democracy either.	What are you trying to say?  There wasn't widespread violence or unrest. I know what necklacing is and who suffered it.  South Africa transitioned between 1990-1994. And it went far smoother than anyone would have predicted. South Africa is a young nation, Europe had MULTIPLE genocides recently. People need to get off their high horses.	0

gipxdt3	Nice work assholes	I understand your argument and I 100% agree that companies do not owe anyone a platform for their views and can make and enforce whatever rules they want. Freedom of speech as guaranteed by the first amendment has nothing to do with forcing companies to pay for servers and infrastructure to host and distribute your message.  Where I think the line has been crossed recently is that the US government has put tech CEOs on trial and foreign states have manipulated our media. Facebook is under pressure from the US government to take these actions. Do you think that no one in the US government has had a talk with tech executives that lead to these changes in moderation? If tech companies are bullied or intimidated or manipulated or incentivized by the state, then yes, it does become an issue of first amendment rights and free speech.	Its fucked, but private companies can do what they want.	None	I completely agree	0

He has got to be trolling. SA has huge problems with democracy, rule of law and climate change related issues.  Edit: there wasn't peaceful transition to democracy either.	If you read just a bit lower, you would see that the ANC, the party that actually negotiated the transition of government, condemned the action. In my parents country, it's called Jungle justice.  It's when local, usually uneducated villagers want to be vigilantes and take justice into their own hands, very few actual apartheid politicians would have actually faced it because they did not line with black people, especially the kind that would practice jungle justice or necklacing as it's called in south Africa.  The actual targets of necklacing were low-level black apartheid police informants, but these were again  independent small, village/township mobs separate from the main movement. It's a complete overexaggeration to call the end of apartheid a violent transition because of a few, sporadic, village mobs, you might call the civil rights movement a violent transition to equal rights because of the black Panthers then.	0

They flat out need to redesign the level, and that's not something easily done for an "event".	So...the hotfix isn't all bad, as the SF Force and D.N.A. have been made into pretty good weapons now. The Ripper isn't complete garbage, but the Malak's Bane and the Techspert are still trash. Granted the Malak's Bane is useable in regular play, maybe even Arms Race, but it's nowhere near what it needs to be for M10/M11 play.  Let's not forget that GBX is considering the crystals not depleting an event instead of a permanent adjustment to the Guardian Takedown. There's so much more wrong with this event than just the crystals.	None	Personally I don't think the level needs a complete redesign. It needs a few tweaks, but not completely. If they added check points so that falling off wasn't such a jarring experience and fixed the loot pool so that the weapons specific to the Guardian Takedown actually dropped, this event would be much more worth the effort. The crystals not depleting simply are not enough. Guardian Takedown is too much hassle and stress for the "rewards" that are given out.	0

For many specs, your raid spot depended on getting your BIS one, which was made worse by the fact that there was a cap on how many you could get early on. So it's completely understandable that this one feature would be considered a massive black mark on an otherwise good expansion.	i think people focus too much on legendary acquisition and forgot how good the other parts of the xpac were. there werent many complaints at all except for legendary acquisition	This feels like definite nostalgia talking to me. Off the top of my head legiondaries were pretty bad bc it took so long to be able to target them. I remember getting the one I wanted for a character about a week before BFA dropped and not really being able to use it. Also was never really a fan of the AP grind tho I did love having my weapon always guaranteed. Order halls were also super hit or miss for me and I hated the rogue one.

Now we need to get rid of government intervention and set up a light base line. But now we are too far in debt, too far down the rabbit hole. It’s impossible to turn back because too many people are supported by the system. The system can’t be toppled over or the livelihoods of too many will be at risk.

Zendaya in Spiderman was the equivalent of putting glasses on a super model and calling her a librarian	hm  i hear about her a lot in my school. my friend got heated over me saying i didn’t find her attractive, so i think people are quite passionate about her  someone i think who is very above average is someone like willow smith or natalie portman, both have “striking” features that translates in a feminine way.  the main thing i find confusing about why people find her attractive is that she has generally masculine features. in this photo for example:  [img](https://www.jetmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/DF-11029-750x375.jpg)	0
gjpy27n	Does anybody see a double standard here?	Additionally, isn't it strange that 50% more BLM protests were violent than the right leaning protests? (As a ratio, not absolute)	I love how "gotchas" like the first are so often hypocritical.   Especially since they're using 'violence' and not actual 'wrongdoing', and at least the cops *pretend* to hold people accountable. BLM ignores or outright endorses riots, and ignores how those riots literally kill people.  They've also attacked government buildings and cops and officials on many occasions.	None	That can't possibly be true. There were blm protests in hundreds of cities. Hell I saw three personally and I didn't even drive out of my way to see them and I don't live in an urban center or a college town.  There are thousands of blm protests that you don't hear about because nothing happens.	0

Yes, only a little under 1 in 15. Which is significantly worse than the odds of a police officer shooting anyone in their entire career, black or white.  The same idiot also claimed riots were mostly started by cops and white supremacists. In the same post. As if that would make the movement significantly less responsible.

I don’t think these groups are going to like all the scrutiny they now have for the first time from the national security state.

This sub is so funny.  The purpose of the FOIA request is to provide a basis for Pershing County to increase law enforcement, at least tripling it. The county would like to increase enforcement on playa pre- and post- the event and on the roads in and out.  That would allow more arrests and citations and give the county more ammunition to completely end the event which the current sheriff has argued for years.

It's going to happen and it's going to get people sick. We just need to keep the influx of cases to a manageable level e.g. "flatten the curve."	Brief summary:   * Construction projects can be worked on insofar as they can be while still maintaining social distancing * Elective surgeries can be done, as long as nurses, doctors and all medical staff have proper PPE's (not sure what qualifies as elective surgery?) * Why can't we open up more things? Because we have enough data to extrapolate that opening up things like more businesses would be a bad move in terms of keeping this thing under control.	None	I don't think he did.  He mentioned that we (we being WA state) took a more aggressive stance on things like construction closing down, and have had good numbers as a result, backing up the open things up slowly kind of approach we're now just beginning to ramp up.	0

The characters are caricatures like in an SNL skit except they grow through the show.	Objectively speaking The Office is probably the most solid show. It doesnt really have ups and downs and apart from 1 season without Steve Carell which was quite bad IMO they ended it really good and were consistently funny except for that 1 season. Brooklyn 99 is great but it's more of a cheap comedy like the big bang theory, although still quite funny. In Office you'll see weird hilarious jokes that you'll never see anywhere else. Same with community	I haven’t watched the office yet but I love the other two shows, will I like the office?    I watched a couple episodes of the British version and it just made me want to eat rat poison	That's a really good description of it. I'm not saying it's bad.

Other than wasting her time did she get assaulted? Dir she get killed? Charged with a crime she didn't commit? No so its a nonissue tbh.	The officer had no right to stop. Some will claim because of race some will claim because police have too much power. But the Crux of the argument is that he had no right to pull her over.	Big ol' nothin' being posted and people are gonna find a way to bring all these things they assume into it. This is why social media is bad. One persons minor inconvenience is now ground to try and make a global outrage. Its pathetic really.	No it's not a non-issue. He's wasted police time, civilian time, and taxpayer time. Police are not there to check in on people. That's unconstitutional, wasteful, and gives the cop too much power. Just because you personally don't care if a cop stops you whenever the fuck they want for whatever reason (see stop and frisk laws and how they're received), doesn't mean it's not an issue.

fus7axd	Guard troops amid protests cost nearly $25M in California	I hold it that a little rebellion now and then is a good thing, and as necessary in the political world as storms in the physical.

An observation of this truth should render honest republican governors so mild in their punishment of rebellions as not to discourage them too much.

(Green Party candidate Peter Camejo got 5% of the popular vote, siphoning off potential Davis supporters.) Similarly, Wisconsin was able to get a [recall election (which failed) in 2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin_gubernatorial_recall_election) against a governor [who had only 52% of the vote in 2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Wisconsin_gubernatorial_election).

fvyu0am	What do you think are the biggest issues	&gt; totally outside of the western mindset Christian mindset  I think that will matter less and less as secularism takes hold in the coming decades.	I think modernism is the biggest problem facing Orthodoxy today.  Modernism in the sense of discarding or altering or reinterpreting  the teachings of the holy fathers, the saints and sacred tradition so that the church can be acceptable to modern and worldly sensibilities.      The second biggest problem is the desire for power among the heirarchs.    In America the biggest problem is that it is totally outside of the western mindset Christian mindset.  I am starting to think it's almost impossible for the church to thrive here except for individual communities here and there.   Like all faiths there is a tension between traditionalists and modernists, liberal and conservative.  I am a conservative traditionalist, so I see a problem is liberal modernists, but they would say the same thing about me.	None	None	0

There’s a certain crowd that just turns into NPCs when it comes to Cuba, either Viva Fidel Cuba is a worker’s paradise or death to Fidel and death to anything remotely related to the government. No room for nuance.  It’s wild, like with the Nazis you can respect and acknowledge German soldiers who just did their job and the military talent in the leadership and people understand the nuance of what you are saying.   But say something that isn’t labeling the Cuban government as the spawn of Satan or the second coming of Christ and you are gonna get a wave of butthurt.  Both the leftists who adore Castro and the exiles who pathologically hate it are fucking obnoxious.	Miami Cubans are downright odd	Cubans in Miami have a petition for Netflix to remove it.

fz3f4zx	Already updated my 1* review for this ridiculous bottleneck	&gt; Putting a cap on ranks means they become unattainable for a large number of players even in the long term.  ....That's how ranking systems work. Not everyone can be the best. If you are silver and better than the worse person in the 3125 gold 1 players, then that person shouldn't be gold anymore.  &gt; A good system rewards the time you invest into the game not just the money you spend, this ain't it!   This is a problem with the business model of mobile games in general, it doesn't really have anything to do with the player counts in the ranking system. Most mobile games are pay to win.	The problem with this is given enough time everyone should reach endgame, I made it as a f2p (took me 18months but i got there). Putting a cap on ranks means they become unattainable for a large number of players even in the long term.  This means in 18 months from now there will still be players who can't buy lego books or sacred shards even tho they have good 3x3 arena teams.  A good system rewards the time you invest into the game not just the money you spend, this ain't it!	I’m currently in silver 1. Which has a decent number of teams I do not consider ‘good’. This tier has a cap of 15000. Just looking at the teams here in S1, there aren’t enough top end accounts to hold all the gold spots. Platinum is hard fought over but that’s only 300 spots, the amount of gold 3v3 spots is massively higher.  I’m prepared to be proven wrong, but I don’t think gold should be hard for getting-towards-end-game players. It’s obviously not for people with rares and garbage gear, but that’s the point.  People seriously need to stop raging about things we haven’t reached yet. Same with every you tuber saying whales will buy multiple accessories per day. Idiots.	That is how skill based ranking systems work yes, I am under no illusion that this is a skill based game, it's rng at its finest therefore there is no reason for roadblocks.   Yes it is a problem with mobile games in general however I feel Raid is worse than the majority out there, they do not value time at all while others at least give you something in exchange.	0

We were told we'd have deaths in the hundreds of millions, possibly even billions all throughout the start of this, but inspite of that, we have nations that never locked down at all, having no better and no worse performance than nations that went full totalitarian lockdown.   this whole "WERE NEVER GOING TO BE SAFE UNTIL A VACCIENE HAPPENS, AND WE MUST LIVE IN A STATE OF LOCKDOWN UNTIL THEN!!!" push that we're getting now is absolute insanity.

g28rvoj	Beginner here, what is the strongest "Summoner-type" build ? Please ?	Exo Cru Druid is still decent damage output, and its healing will be useful no matter what.   Any build set up with Druid and Dievdirby in it can be considered to be near-optimal support for any kind of class. your ability to heal and buff is supreme in that 2 class comp. your third class can be practically any class. at that point you really just have to 'season to taste' so to speak.   I believe Seedbomb actually works very well with summons, since your summoner will usually have about 8-11 summons active at any time, plus your statues, plus your carnivory plants. ive never done it myself, but on paper it looks like it would do very well. someone more versed on druid could probably tell you. Carnivory is worthless on bosses that dont summon any minions unfortunately, but i think for Challenge mode, you can probably make some legit use out of max carnivory seed bomb, and mass summons from your ally.   something like this for example  https://tos.neet.tv/skill-planner#4157.15246175.2f5a6c8591a1b1.112f3a546a75  The best Classes to pick for your last circle, from what i can see, is any of these  1. Priest - High healing focused 2. Plauge doctor - mid healing and mid damage focus 3. Crusader - mid healing and Mid damage focus 4. Miko - High Support focused Low damage focus 5. Exorcist - High damage Focus  imo, your three best options are Miko Priest or Exorcist. i'd lean towards exorcist just because of the solo damage it provides. Priest and miko make for more raid friendly picks.	Thanks a lot !  So this build will allow her to heal herself too, so is  Exo-crus-druid useless to support her ? What can I choose to have symbiosis with her Summoner build ?	hands down, i think the highest damage class right now, is actually Necro>Sorc>Featherfoot for the weekly boss. some dude just dropped like double the damage of all other top scores using that the other day.   do necro > Sorc > Feather for leveling, your pets will just chew through zones. feather does next to nothing for you until endgame, since you'll just oneshot everything with blood curse, but not drain any HP Back. if anything taking featherfoot early will severely hamper your mapping speeds.    the way this class plays, is through self damage, and massive self healing. your pets will actually heal you when they damage things under 'blood curse' debuff, and you can keep nearly 100% uptime on blood curse.   https://tos.neet.tv/skill-planner#2196g.25447581.1a253a416188b5c5.1f3141788595aa.1122314f5a718a95	Thanks a lot it is very helpful!

That's how I suggest my students (I'm a tutor) study! I just add the constraint that they also need to be able to describe any intuitions behind formulas, and the motivations for definitions. If someone can do the problems, explain the intuition, and explain why things are defined the way they are, then they understand it, and there are better uses of time.	None	None	0

But on contending teams; teams that have a legitimate chance to win a title...have an asshole who is among the best on the team.  An asshole that challenges his teammates, and backs up his words and actions.  Bird?  Asshole.  Jordan?  Asshole. Kobe? Asshole.  Lebron?  Asshole.    Go through the Celtics roster right now.  Who is an asshole?  Smart is irritating, but not an asshole.  Walker and Brown are nice.  Hayward, too.  Maybe Tatum can become one.	None	None	0

g82qrrl	And then we get charged for parking in the wrong lot.	Id rather them work on scaling up parking facilities and road traffic solutions instead of just changing an arm and a leg. Id be different if the additional charge was going towards making improvements to parking/roads. Its like the cost of maintaining a parking spot is sky rocketing. Demand is just thought the roof. They need to start working on increasing supply with the extra money they make from demand.  Its an infrastructure  problem thats built into the campus. Theres literally only two roads north/south and 3 exits, that has to change at some point, traffic is already at maximum during class already so that should take priority and once thats handled increase parking. Rates for parking should cover all the road maintenance and parking enforcement. It shouldn't be arbitrarily raised to limit poor peoples access to spots or cushion other departments pockets.	If everyone was allowed to bring a car no questions asked, you'd have 2-3x the amount of parking required plus the need to handle that traffic. No thanks.	None	None	0
g84ghpv	Feeling some gender confusion in the bedroom	That does make sense, yeah. I don't know your relationship so I hesitate to say for sure "yeah go for it!", but having them try it out could be a good way to normalize it in your head. Definitely just speculation here, but it seems to me like having positive experiences with being called "good boy" then reinforcing with gender affirming language afterwards would be a good way to help train your brain to be ok with being a lady who gets off on being called that. Again totally up to you,  it'd involve talking to your partner about the details of what you want and them being cool with giving it a shot and following through on aftercare, but if that seems like a possibility it might be worth a shot?	Thank you, it does help actually.   About my partner: they don't actually call me that, ever. Part of why I'm bothered by this is that I would like them to, but telling them that I still enjoy it kind of makes me feel like an impostor, if that makes sense.	I know just hearing this won't necessarily make it feel ok, but you really can't help what turns you on. As long as nobody is being hurt by it (and I can't imagine anybody would be by this), there's nothing wrong with doing whatever you you want in bed. It doesn't make you any less of a woman to have that particular kink, I'm sure there's cis women who are the same too. You don't have to feel bad about it, it's totally ok. That being said, if it is something that is bothering you it's also totally reasonable to talk to your partner about it and have them stop calling you that (even for a while as you sort out your feelings on it).  Tl:dr don't worry about it. If it bugs you enough that it doesn't bug you its reasonable to stop, otherwise you do you!	None	0

ga1wzb9	Informed citizen tells off a cop	Maybe its possible, but it is 100% true - well beyond a maybe - that this police officer made up a law that doesn't exist.  There is no world where anyone should be defending a cop that makes up laws to try to stop people from doing things.  If he had brought up the actual law that was broken? Sure, I'd be on your side, but a cop can't start making up shit to discourage people form doing stuff. That is an incredibly dangerous precedent to set.	Bicycle riding on the Rainbow Harbor Esplanade is prohibited in excess of three (3) miles per hour between the hours of ten o'clock (10:00) a.m. and ten o'clock (10:00) p.m., except City employees in the performance of their duties.

That was 3 years ago (look I'm still alive!) and what I can say having been through it is that these were very common symptoms of my anxiety.

gbfneml	Honest questions about Calgary citizens	I was really trepidatious about Calgary’s winters moving from Toronto, but I agree that I like Calgary’s more. I think it’s partly because Calgary is one of the sunniest cities in Canada, and also one of the driest — which made a much bigger difference than I thought it would.	I like Calgary a bit more than Toronto, although Toronto does have more diversity and more vibrant.   \- Toronto's housing problem is a real issue, the same for the entire Southern Ontario  \- Calgary is only one hour away from those great mountains and lakes, I love mountains. Ontario is too flat, Muskoka is only worth going during fall time and it takes at least two hours. Also, Alberta has bighorn sheeps!   \- I hate to drive on DVP and 401, I also hate TTC. I actually feel Calgary has just the right size, not too big, not too small, with decent public transit. I drive regularly between Toronto and Sarnia, 401 and 402 are super boring.    \- I feel people in Calgary are somewhat nicer to deal with  \- I like Calgary's winter more so than Toronto's, always feel that way, not sure why	None	The sun is one of my favorite features. It may be cold some days, but if I'm staying in the house, at least it feels like a nice day because the sun is shining.	0

gbfv2cl	Looking for a Firefox based browser that uses much less RAM	&gt;A web browser might, with a lot of tabs open, use like 4gb ram  I have 13 tabs open now and Firefox is already at 4GB.   Like any good application, Firefox will use the RAM that is available.  There's nothing wrong with recommending either 16GB or 32GB in this day and age. Although of course 16GB+ has a diminishing return.	I would have said 16 would be the current sweet spot for desktop users. Unless you are doing some pretty specific high memory tasks (like running multiple vm's) theres no way you will get anywhere near capping that out.  Telling people they 'need' 32 gb to browse the web is kind of overstating it. A web browser might, with a lot of tabs open, use like 4gb ram. Note, Im not disputing that 8 is probably the minimum these days, but 32 for normal desktop usage is just overkill.  I do agree with you though that this is probably not so much a browser issue and that a ram upgrade is a much smarter choice than browser switching.	The bottom line is the reason browsers are taking so much memory is that webpages are getting larger and more complicated. You are only going to get so small and then you will start causing things to break.  A simpler solution is to put more memory in your computer. You have no idea how much better a computer runs with 32 gig even though damn near everyone will tell you that you don't need more than 8 gig. BULLSHIT. Been there and done that at 4,8,16,32 gig and I'm here to tell you 32 gig is the way to go and its not expensive.	try zero return. but whatever	0

I'm partial to the sound of AKG, as I'm particularly sensitive to certain vocal ranges and they have a pronounced dip in exactly that range. So the AKG K712 Pro are my favorite at the moment. I also love AKG's suspension headband system since it doesn't put pressure on the side of your head. These don't put a lot of pressure but still do more than the AKG.  But I've used these and they're fantastic if you've got a basic DAC+amp to drive them with. And an equalizer can solve my vocal sensitivity with them.  And now I just convinced myself to order a set in writing that. I guess I can use them for travel instead of taking along a $400 AKG set that I'm always nervous I'm going to break or have stolen. Also these do have a little more sub-bass than AKG, which can be nice for some music, especially cello & bass heavy ensembles.	None	None	0

None	I understand, but it seems the only meaning the question could have relates to the art design.  'Will they use the same sets, models, props'? Highly unlikely. Will they use the same art design team? Possible. Will that make it the same 'cinematic universe'? Even if they don't use the same art design team, the locations will likely look 'similar'. How different can they be?  I just don't think the question is particularly meaningful. The Marvel plan does not apply to everything.	0

gcfhom1	tfw you claim to fight for the working class but they really want nothing to do with you	The Soviet response to the Hungarian uprising in 1956 and the Prague Spring are what the word 'Tankie' refers to: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tankie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tankie)	Prague spring was when the soviets co-ordinated with other Warsaw Pact nations to invade Czechoslovakia because the government was becoming more liberal and saw it has a threat to stability in the Warsaw Pact.  The Poland issue was the solidarity march which saw many workers go on strike to protest the communist government. It was kinda the first series of events which would destabilise the communists in Eastern Europe.  The Hungarian uprising in 1956 was an attempt by Hungary to liberalise and to leave the Warsaw Pact with a new leader in charge of Hungary. This saw the Soviets launch an invasion of Hungary in which Hungarian rebels would fight the soviets in the streets of Budapest. Their new leader was executed.

Unfortunately his offense other than dunking and cutting is really bad, he can barely dribble the ball and he was unplayable in the playoffs because if you can't dribble or shoot as a wing, you're screwed. I hope he improves as he's still young, if he becomes passable on offense he'll be extremely valuable for you guys	Does anyone have a summary of Derrick Jones Jr and what he brings to our team?  Please and thank you.	None	0
gd2vmip	wish i never found stephanie buttermore	Do you have a source for that? I’d never heard of her until this thread, and just checked out her all in YouTube video. I’m curious now.	Hello OP. I'm sorry to hear that all-in made you feel worse.  Please know that Stephanie isn't the best person to look up to when it comes to ED recovery. She is known for faking her recovery. During her 6th month she started to restrict hard and photoshops her photos. Don't believe a word she says that your body will find a "set-point" by eating tons of tons of calories. Her all-in method is glamourized binge-eating disorder. I had BED before and my body never found a set-point nor recognized my hunger cues; It just got worse.  I suggest you have to seek a dietitian, professional, or specialist. She is NOWHERE near licensed nor qualified on ED recovery. I hope everything works out for you.	None	None	0
gd6m38p	Street Fighter V Season 5 next character revealed?	It says in the tweet “Player Character Daigo”.      That’s a term video game developers use for the playable character.	I dont think hell be a playable character, but part of Akiras moveset since Rival Schools is known for its partner attacks. And who else would be a better fit to represent that than Daigo, her big brother?	None	Yeah, but that’ll probably change because it’d make more sense to add him in Akira’s moveset. I don’t think we’re gonna get two playable RS characters. If that was the case, Batsu should be the second character since he hasn’t been in a fighting game since TvC.	0

ge12qlq	Why don't you practice what you preach, Aunt Lori?	I fail to understand how she wants women to be mindless and uneducated but also wants them to homeschool. If I want my (hypothetical) kids to learn advanced math and science from being homeschooled, shouldnt I also know it to teach it to them? I mean, the obvious solution is to send your kids to school or a dual enrollment university program, but if she insists on homeschool, then she should insist on educated mothers.	What are the chances a man who isnt Loris husband is approaching Lori to talk to her about his sexual desires, how often, etc? Wouldnt that be considered inappropriate by most peoples standards? I dont know any dudes that talk to other ladies about all the sex they want to have. Sure, peer to peer convos like this happen but I seriously doubt this scenario ever happened. Lori loves to bring up these stories where she paints women as mean and withholding harpies. But yet Loris idea of the perfect wife is the quiet homemaker who offers her body 24/7 whether or not she wants to, is a maid, has zero opinions, is a mindless robot, homeschools, doesnt vote, worships her husband, and not a Biden supporter (you know cuz babies).	None	She doesn't mean advanced math or science though. She just means Bible verses and fake history.	0
ge13q5e	Don't want kids? Just have one anyway and then hope it works out!	Lol, r/thanksimcured Lori.	Lori's actually posted about PPD before. She basically says that the mother is being selfish and "wants" to feel depressed and if mother was a good enough Christian, she would be all joyful. Of course, she says this about other forms of depression and mental illness. Because everyone with these conditions should be told it's all their fault, apparently	So, I guess post partum depression (not to mention other disorders that could interfere with bonding with a child) dont exist.

Yeah I was there with my family this past Wednesday the day before Thanksgiving and there were hordes of people. The entire parking lot was full. I wanted to come back when it less crowded and it definitely was very quiet today. I chilled at the lookout tower for probably 20 minutes or so and nobody else was there.

geeoh5x	Lana Wachowski is auctioning a Matrix 4 prop, revealing name of new Zion ship	That sounds so fuckin sick	A popular theory is that in *Matrix 4* Neo and Trinity won't remember their past lives, at least not in the beginning of the film.  Makes sense if they are approached by rebels from the ship that bears the name of the Goddess of Memory, to awaken their memories.	None	Does it? I don’t agree man. Them “forgetting their past lives” thing just seems so obvious and crap.	0
geeshfk	yo what exactly is The Merovingian?	There’s something I kind of had a hard time grasping and that was Neo having a choice in defeating Smith. Did he really?  Because the entire purpose of the One is to return to the source and inseminate their special code to reset the Matrix.  But it Revolutions Smith asked Neo, “Why do you persist?” And he responded, “Because I choose too.” Which isn’t necessarily untrue. But Neo also realized the only way to defeat Smith was to allow Smith to overwrite him, so the Machines could delete him.  Neo even said, “You were right, Smith. You were always right. It was inevitable.”   So if he pretty much still had to follow through with the purpose of the One. Right?	His original purpose is vague, but the consensus seems to be that he either was or was part of the operating system of a previous version of the Matrix.  What we do know for certain is that he believes that choice is not real. Choices are merely effects that follow a logical cause. So he must have been a governing force within a Matrix version that predates the current paradigm of allowing (and mitigating) human choices. Obviously, he still believes in this philosophy, as we see in Reloaded.  Ultimately, Neo seems to have proved him wrong, defeating Smith by making a **choice** that a machine or program would (ostensibly) be incapable of - self sacrifice.  But I submit that the Oracle makes a similar choice when she allows Rama Kandra to trade her deletion code to the Merovingian for Sati's safe passage into the Matrix.	None	> So if he pretty much still had to follow through with the purpose of the One. Right?   Ultimately, yes.  Except that he did it HIS way.  The biggest difference is that Zion was not destroyed. Neo unified the entire Matrix and accepted reload. But this set the Matrix almost immediately to an unstable state, very similar to the conditions that signal that reload is imminent, because rejections are still near peak levels.  I hope all this gets sorted out in the sequel.	0
gepam24	How fucked is Greg Ellis?	Rowling claimed these opinions, not the poster. Hitler killed a lot of innocent people, for anyone not up to speed on the Holocaust. Doesn’t mean I agree with Hitler simply by relaying his gross opinions to others. We can be adults and have nuanced conversations without attacking each other as transphobes.	Saying you support trans people, but dont support their gender identity, means you dont actually support trans people. Dont bring people up to speed on something youre wrong about. You sound like a transphobe yourself.	[Here's a good breakdown of the J K Rowling controversy](https://www.glamour.com/story/a-complete-breakdown-of-the-jk-rowling-transgender-comments-controversy/amp)   Basically she says that she supports trans people but you're only a man or woman if you're born that way.	> We can be adults  Ahh, I remember my first day on Reddit too.	0

gf1shbh	[2020 Day 8] 2019 flashbacks	[2019 Day 2](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/2) was a puzzle kind of like today's one, where you make a program that reads a bunch of instructions and jump around between them.  What made it harder was:  1. They made you re-use this computer in a bunch of later questions, adding tons of complexity so if your answer to the first puzzle was a bit convoluted it just got worse and worse 2. The puzzle explanation is much more confusing and difficult to read (IMO). Check out [Day 5](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/5) and [Day 9](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/9)	Can someone ELI5 intcode and what happened in 2019?	None	To be exact iirc the second day and then every odd day starting from the fifth was about intcode and I think one of the big problems is that it makes it pretty much impossible to skip puzzles if you don't have time or for whatever other reason and you e.g. also can't just skip a day or two if you don't like the puzzle or topic.  But on the other hand, it enabled some amazing puzzles later on that would just not be possible otherwise.	0
gf55r7t	Safe for 3 girls?	Honestly, it's probably safer than most countries, not just the USA. Almost no crime happens in the hotel zone. It's not part of the city.

I tell the same thing to my hick neighbors when they question  my travel to Mexico	The Cancun hotel zone is likely safer than your hometown, if you live in the USA.	I recall reading that Quintana Roo has the murder rate of a typical non-gun-owning European country.

gg94tjp	Interest in establishing a more balanced and competitive format of Gambit	My sister and I kept playing on that first day even after the 24 hours was up. We stayed in the queue and kept getting matches. Much sweatier matches. But like you said, there wasn’t an established meta that steamrolls everything. It was just random guns and strategies. It felt so real!	My unpopular opinion: day 1 gambit was the best gambit. It was swingy and unpredictable and that was glorious. Invading created the possibility of come from behind wins instead of just winning in the first minute of the game by snowballing. Every change they made since them has made the format worse.

Tell me, how is a minimum wage worker meant to increase their wealth? I'd genuinely like to understand your perspective.	It's amusing to me that these leftists think 'the rich' are going to peacefully and agreeably give up the wealth they have worked for to people that lack the skills to earn or keep their own money.   It's even more amusing to me that they think politicians would facilitate such a change.	None	I used to make minimum wage.  Get this, after I gained some experience, and got a job that paid better and offered benefits. And get this they actually provided some  training and paid me for it.  I also took advantage of free training that I had to attend on my own time but gave me a certificate confirming the industry knowledge.  I was a bank teller.   I also went to school at night, and got a degree in an area that is in demand. Guess what I never saw minimum wage again.   It’s not hard to understand. If you can get up and go to work and follow orders it’s actually not hard to move up from minimum wage.	0

He didn't mention any major differences in what's under the hood of the key caps on the newer ones other than the obvious external differences in the newer model.

To interrupt a perceived echo chamber, simply upload pictures of your own ideas.	Exactly. If we can't critique the food, WTF are we even doing here? Do we want every post to just have a dozen comments that say:   "Ooh, yum, looks good!"   This is how you go from a discussion board to an echo chamber.	This is going to be applied way too broadly. Some of these meals deserve criticism, claiming they're low-cal when OP obviously doesn't recognize the caloric value of oil or other parts of the meal	I agree with the rule because I understand where you're coming from, but my go-to meal *is* disgusting because getting creative on 1200 will inevitably yield some hilariously weird shit.

Alpha fold is highly specific Ml Algo for specific needs, while the field itself is enormously huge, even I as an undergrad student know that.

I don't have allergies to scents, and I'm not especially sensitive to bad smells. I did, however, receive a blouse last month that literally stunk up my entire room before I washed it. And stunk up my closet after I did wash it. If your scent isn't coming off after multiple washes, you probably do need to set aside the items for a couple days after washing them.

gj5xbhq	Well, well, well...if it isn’t the consequences of your own actions. Shouldn’t have let Trump slide all these years.	I believe it was more about some kind of rigged election, not just losing it. Apparently he never lost,  something about voting fraud.	I could understand if a group like BLM wanted to invade the Capitol.  They have an actual, important reason for doing that.  Black people are getting killed and the government doesn't care.  Trump supporters, on the other hand, tried to overthrow the government and force Congress to put Trump back in power because losing the election made him feel bad.	R's caught between a rock and a hard place.  R's constantly going on about D's not having a spine.  Hey, guess what, R's?  You now have the opportunity to show off that spine of yours, or forever have your names entangled with the Insurrectionist-In-Chief's.	He can't accept the fact that he didn't win, because he was raised to believe that a loser was the worst possible thing you could be.  So he needed excuses and settled on a conspiracy theory about his opponents rigging the election against him.  He's in Boy Who Cried Wolf territory now.

gj5zxgz	Inky's PLO Stream Journey 2020 Wrap Up!	What's your usual play style? How do you win at those stakes with so little (apparently) aggression? Are these mostly zoom hands?	Wanted to post an update to my streaming!  I'm a high stakes live plo reg (5/10-50/100), pivotting to grinding some online cash to keep sharp during the pandemic.  Here's my graph for the year, started streaming at [Inky\_Poker](https://www.twitch.tv/inky_poker) some 1/2, 2/5 Zoom PLO and some study/coaching streams in November, putting in volume, running hot, and doing well.  Also very pleased to hit 55 ATH viewers, averaging a nice 25-30 viewers. At first I was getting 3-8 for weeks and thought it'd never grow, so I'm very pleased, even if it's not that big.  Hoping to start doing hand of the day type stuff on [Insta](https://www.instagram.com/inkypoker/) and some vlogging when I eventually get back to high stakes live PLO.  Here's to another good year of check/raising and barrelling down. Hope to see some of you join the stream! :)	None	Hmm, I'm surprised you say that. Why do you feel that I have so little aggression? I personally would consider myself one of the more aggressive regs, barring a few over-the-top regs. I have the highest raise cbet and likely one of the higher later streets of any reg I've seen.  For the most part I just play the style that I feel is mostly likely to win the most. I try not to think too seriously about styles, that stuff is just for fun. I am a strong believer of just playing each hand the best, which is especially true with zoom. Live and HU I think metagame would have more value.	0

gj6baq6	My day to day experience	What kind of small local tour features people getting dropped??	Reminds me of a funny story. I did a small local tour, and before the kick off, they asked "all the professionals with the carbon bikes" to line up in the front row. They all looked at my clyde frame with my "chunky" crosscheck and 105s, snickering in the process. They stopped snickering when they were getting dropped by a fat guy with tetris socks.	None	The kind that gives two police escorted groups. First wave is the "pro” group and second is the everyone/family friendly/low speed group. First wave rides 30 miles, second is only 15.  I'm just saying, I got a lot of dirty looks that day when everything started, and a lot of shocked looks that I stayed in the front of the pack. Depending on where you were on the route,  you were asked to stop and wait for the second wave, or would be picked up by the support vehicles and taken to the next checkpoint. The routs cut through and circled a small city, so reconnecting with either group wasn't hard	0

gj9hpeg	How are serial killers treated in prison?	Not generally, unless they were serial killers of children. It does vary, but by and large many serial killers "enjoy" a grudging sense of respect or fear from their fellow inmates. For some this leaves them incredibly isolated even if they're gen pop. For others they use those feelings to sort of establish themselves as King of the Pen wherever they are.

gja47n3	Matt and the ATV	After seeing it I thought it had to be fake. You don't flip an ATV and then end up intertwined several feet away. If it's real, they're lucky neither broke a leg or worse.

gjakcbx	Was Hurricane Matthew Really a Category 5?	This is the answer. They're related, but not strictly so.	Its possible for hurricanes to peak into cat 5 while still having pressures in the 930s, just like its possible for cat 4s to have pressures in the 910s and 920s. While pressure and wind speed are closely related, they aren't a direct 1 to 1 conversion; a good example this year would be Delta, having extremely fast winds due to explosive intensification but barely peaking into the 950s before rapidly weakening. Matthew peaked as a cat 5 but didn't remain there long, which is realistic given its pressure as well.	None	None	0

gjd4h4t	Hotfix notes 01-14-2021: I will crap myself if the Malak's Bane is the new meta sniper like the Hellwalker is for shotguns.	&gt;  There's so much more wrong with this event than just the crystals.    They flat out need to redesign the level, and that's not something easily done for an "event".	So...the hotfix isn't all bad, as the SF Force and D.N.A. have been made into pretty good weapons now. The Ripper isn't complete garbage, but the Malak's Bane and the Techspert are still trash. Granted the Malak's Bane is useable in regular play, maybe even Arms Race, but it's nowhere near what it needs to be for M10/M11 play.  Let's not forget that GBX is considering the crystals not depleting an event instead of a permanent adjustment to the Guardian Takedown. There's so much more wrong with this event than just the crystals.	None	Personally I don't think the level needs a complete redesign. It needs a few tweaks, but not completely. If they added check points so that falling off wasn't such a jarring experience and fixed the loot pool so that the weapons specific to the Guardian Takedown actually dropped, this event would be much more worth the effort. The crystals not depleting simply are not enough. Guardian Takedown is too much hassle and stress for the "rewards" that are given out.	0

gjevz6m	Got this email twice in a week?

So then you're not working doubles, so the email doesn't apply to you.	i dont work more than 5hrs tho, my shifts are 4hrs30min which means i take 20 minute breaks so im confused. I usually take my 20 minute towards the end of my shift but with 10 minutes left of my shift so that i can at least take one more order before i clock out.	"Failing to comply with these requirements may lead to disciplinary action"  That sounds like a warning to me.  Back when I did double-shifts, I was told that you cannot just take your breaks at any time, you have to take your first 20-minute break during the first shift, your second 20-minute break during the second shift, and yes, you have to take the 30 minute break sometime before the 5th hour.

These people are not all on the same side. You're just dismissing everyone you don't like and claiming they're all together.	Yes it is.. because Assange is most definitely on their side. Not sure why people insist on not seeing this.  Greenwald, Assange, Dore, Tulsi, Ball, Pool, Rubin, Owens, Carlson, Trump, Putin etc etc.  They are all on the same side and just working that side from different angles.	So we're clear, he said Assange was the first victim and called for the president to pardon him on a network the president definitely watches.  Not all bad here	They all spend 99% of their time and effort attacking the Democratic party... so yes they clearly are on the same side.	0
gjgizht	Do you have to make a backstory for your dnd character? My sister doesnt want to write one, and idk what to say about it.	I dunno, in my experience characters with no backstory quickly run the risk of becoming loot gremlins or murder hobos.  Those characters basically lack any form of self control, and are just a tool for the player to do "whatever". Because typically they are disconnected from the world and don't care about anything besides their stats.	Meh. It's not the end of the world. As a dm, I am fine if players don't have a crazy elaborate backstory or any story at all really. Her character's story will be created as she plays.	None	Strongly disagree. Murder hobos come in all shapes and sizes and have nothing to do with backstories. It's the person behind the character. One of my favorite characters I've ever played was a Paladin with basically zero backstory.  He was just a rich kid that wanted to build a legacy and fight evil.  Stop pretending like an in depth backstory stops Murder hobos lol.	0

Sometimes your shots just dont fall and the guy just got here. I think he has potential from what my eyes saw.	The white guy we got from BKN doesn't need to touch the floor ever again. How the hell he made it to the pros is beyond me. Also I know we have a ton of people out but damn Silas, what offense were we trying to run the last 5 minutes of the game.

I'll never understand that line of thinking. 3 simple qualifications. Are they a consenting, human, adult? Then you're welcome to have sex with them. All 3 are of equal importance so you can change the order to fit your priorities if you wish: adult human who gives consent? Check. Human consenting adult? Still green light. How about a consenting adult human? All engines go. Just have to check off all 3 of those boxes and its all good.  Edit: since this apparently needs to be said, a very important 4th stipulation: NOT IMMEDIATE FAMILY! Thats not just disgusting and morally reprehensible, it's ludicrously dangerous. You wanna fuck up your gene pool? Cuz thats how you fuck up your gene pool.  Second edit: I am amazed at how strongly I've had to defend incest being wrong.	ah yes, just like how gay marriage has legalized pedophelia and bestiality, acknowledging nonbinary genders means that children can be adults	and a few on those list arent always seen as neccasary by the right	0

gjoz4n9	Happy 99th Birthday to Plymouth's 1957 & 1958 spokeswoman, Betty White (1958 Plymouth Fury pictured)	Well, didn't the last scene in the movie involve the crushed Christine slowly warping and creaking as it tries to repair itself? I may be remembering incorrectly, but all I'm saying is that if that was the scene, it's totally possible.  Imagine the self-repair scene(s) with modern CGI. It was already awesome with the outdated CGI of the early 1980's.	Id love to see a Christine sequel where Betty White is running people over in Christine	None	Dude that wasn’t cgi, Christine on fire was real. It was driven by a real stunt driver with near black tint at night while the car was on fire sometimes reaching 70mph on a small country road. The scene where Christine repairs herself was completely practical effects and good camera work, they built a replica shell car and stuck it to a machine that imploded it, they recorded the shell car being imploded and played the footage in reverse to make it look like Christine was repairing herself, the genius of John Carpenters movies is that he is a practical effects mastermind, “The Thing” was a movie that was so gruesome and terrifying because of John Carpenters practical effects, in fact it was too gross and terrifying for audiences at the time. Christine was a project that John Carpenter took to prove that he could make a great movie with amazing practical effects and have almost no gore at all, and holy shit did he prove it. If it means stopping classic plymouths from being destroyed I’ll support modern cgi but  when it comes to good film making, good practical effects never look outdated	0

gjroufg	AMA: 2nd Year M7 MBA, International, Amazon PM Internship and returning as full-time!	Can you give an example of what a non-tech PM at Amazon might be managing?	Yes but its more complex than it initially seems.  At Amazon in particular:  PM-Technical roles go ***almost*** exclusively to those will engineering/comp sci degrees or who have PM or related (for example tech consulting) experience. There are some exceptions but this is the general rule of thumb.  PM-Non Tech can be anyone. In non-tech roles you will be working on more business problems and less technical problems. Once in the door you can move to PM-T if you show the right technical acumen.  For other companies, Google is very STEM focussed (with some exceptions). Facebook and Apple generally have way fewer PM roles than Google or Amazon. Non-FAANG companies it will be very dependent on the company.  From my experience, SWE work experience isn't needed (but it helps!) but some STEM (particularly engineering) or tech implementation experience is valued as companies want to know you get into the technical details.	Is it true that PM internships usually go to people with a STEM background? Also, could a person with 3 years of Software development experience have a shot at a PM role or do they tend to prefer older folks?	From the MBA job description " Kindle, North America Consumer (such as Retail Systems, Customer and Brand Protection, Marketplace Sales, International Retail, Hardlines, and Softlines), Prime Photos, Prime and Delivery Experience, and Logistics & Transportation. Internships are available in Seattle, WA."  Tech PM roles are typically - Amazon Web Services (AWS), Prime Video, Alexa, Game Services, and Supply Chain Technologies.	0

gjrt5w6	MLK at Communist Training School	We should not take the word of the FBI	What I want to know is why a liberal documentary is getting praise, *MLK/FBI*, for libwashing and giving nuance to right wing character assassination smears against MLK?  He knew a few supposed communists at a time when many blacks were interested in communism due to extreme racism and Jim Crow. One supposed communist was Stanley Levison, a businessman who once affiliated himself with the CPUSA, but stopped in 1957. The other was a soc dem named Bayard Rustin who later in life became a neo-con.  That was enough to publicly smear him as a communist.  But this is all spurious because the documentary made it seem like being a communist was the worst thing since being a Nazi.  I don't even know what to think of the affair and rape allegations. Some say they're true, others say no. I just wonder if we should take the word of the FBI.	None	Absolutely, we should not.   The documentary getting praise by liberals is astounding. I remember watching a right wing propaganda film that featured the same content only in a bombastic way.   When remade with liberal aesthetics and fake nuance, you can sell right wing crap back to liberals.   Most of the Russiagate shit regurgitates old John Bircher Soviet propaganda around active measures in the US and whatnot.	0
gjrtto7	The Midnight Sky is Another Terrible Netflix Release | Review	I find a lot of the sci-fi on Netflix seems to prioritize looking visually appealing, why neglecting to tell a compelling story with interesting themes, a complex plot, and convincing drama.

gjst742	How about a little more real science in Stellaris?	It really wouldn't. It would add excess micro and make settling planets harder, and then not matter at all once you got the right research topics. It would make the early game even more annoying, for zero benefit.	Some of it's fluff. But I've been itching for a more fleshed out habitability system.  Temperature, humidity, pressure, atmospheric gasses etc. would add a neat dimension.  It's one thing to say that a planet is 60% habitable, but is that because it doesn't have breathable gases, or because the high gravity strains our species' biology?  Those are very different engineering problems.  Then again, I've always enjoyed the small scale.  When you've got a hundred planets in your empire the details might just be background noise.	The idea itself isn't bad, it's just not worth the development time. This isn't the type of bonus cosmetic work artists can do while programmers make the actual game. Most people won't bother with reading any of it. And automating the process, like they tried to do in EVE, results in numbers that make no sense.	Yeah, it’s probably something I’m more likely to enjoy in a game that’s built around it, more so than adding it into Stellaris willy nilly	0

None	I have been AP'ing pretty often for over 10 years now. I'm no professional nor am I really good at it. But I can sniff out BS pretty easily just based on my experiences.   If anything about this is an actual exprience, this sounds like a lucid dream, which is often confused with AP. First of all communication with any beings or entities in the "astral" is telepathic. There's no verbal communication. Verbal communication happens in a lucid dream. So the ideas of "guards" talking to you or each other, or using radios just dosnt make any sense in the non-physical realms. In dream yes, but the "astral" has much different set of rules and communication methods.  Also the fact that people use AP as story telling time bugs the hell out of me. Anyone experienced enough to AP at will and just float around wherever they want, aren't going to be running to reddit to tell their crazy story. This stuff is incredibly personal and people blabbing about their experiences is a red flag. After enough experience with AP, you get a sense of what people are saying is a real experience, or BS. It just comes with the territory.  Also Ive seen this exact same story multiple times up here and in the past. Its either the White House or Area-51. Every. damn. time.  Of course to no way to prove this one way or another. It's just my semi-experienced take.	0

The way I look at it, the innocence is gone, but it's not like I did anything wrong or sinful. I've got nothing to be ashamed of even if I don't see myself as a virgin. But I can also see the liberation that can come from seeing the two (rape and sex) as different altogether. If looking at it that way helps you move past or accept what happened, then good for you. That's a huge step.	Thank you for commenting. I also grew up in a religious family. I think it's good to talk about it openly and hopefully remove some of the shame	I'm happy for you! I can relate, but it's honestly a little embarrassing. I'm technically a virgin (as in no penetrative sex), but growing up with a really religious background, I didn't (and still don't) feel like a virgin after my sexual assault. I certainly didn't feel innocent and pure lol. It is honestly to a ridiculous level of weird. Like when I told someone I was waiting until marriage recently, she looked at me and said "What are you, some born-again virgin?" And I honestly had to think about it until it was my friends who stepped in and said "No. He's still a virgin." And only then did I remember that technically I am still a virgin. It's weird. It really messed with me for a long time even though I'm a guy, but eventually I think I just convinced myself that it is what it is and I just kind of accepted it.	None	0

gjtbwqj	I'm tired of #notallmen attittudes from trans women	I don't think saying "all Republicans are bad" is the same thing as saying "all men are bad." Being a Republican is a political position which advocates certain positions that may be harmful to certain groups of people. Saying "all men are bad" is getting angry at a group of people solely for their gender identity, which they cant choose.	It's probably the same reason why when people say " all Republicans are shitbags " The back of my hair still stands up, because I was a Republican for probably 15+ years. Conversely I've identified as male for almost 25 years, so if somebody says " all men are shitbags " The hair on the back of my neck is still going to stand up, because it takes a long time to unravel all that. Even though I'm female, and I've transitioned etc and so on and so forth. When people say things like that, I know for me, I'm still like "well when I presented male I wasn't like that"  so while I agree that not every female only space is going to agree with takes on men being shitbags, you have to understand that at some point this demographic, trans women, may have a little bit more apprehension with regards to that comment. Just because we've transitioned doesn't mean that our pasts are completely erased or forgotten.	None	None	0

gjtsuiz	The teapot letter FINALLY revealed!	Also, while he hates working there (and it is depicted as dull at times), I don’t think Dundee Mifflin is a “dull” place to work, even if it is weird, uncomfortable or chaotic.	None of this letter is in Jims character. Hed never write a sloppy pierce of shit like this.	It’s a nice letter but the sudden request for anal is totally not in Jim’s character. Glad they never included this in the series.	None	0
gjtv51b	What’s a visual novel that completely ruined your experience with a sudden change in tone or had a very bad ending?	Oof, glad I didn’t continue it then	Carpe Diem: Reboot.   While I didn't expect a lot going into it, the ending felt abrupt and pointless, as if the author either lost interest, or didn't care in the first place.	None	None	0
gju3427	Two Ohio residents charged with participating in Capitol riots	Its not limited to the US. There's always a small percentage of any society that fetishizes military and lives in a fantasy land where they're just rugged war heros in waiting.	These right wing groups really love to use military titles and names for themselves.  Is that a US thing because we get off on all those military type shows of force in TV and movies, or do they do it in other countries as well?	None	Funny, they all seem to think they'd be some sort of apocalyptic warlord if society collapsed when the vast bulk of them would be dying from dysentery or cholera	0

gjuabir	I love a blunt walk in the woods as much as the next stoner, but, please throw out the guts and wrappers . You gotta love all types of green and all types of trees . Ya' 'll feel me?	Fuck it. Not worth the risk then. Thankfully I mostly hit my bong these days but next time I do a blunt walk I’ll have it rolled ahead of time.	I mean I've heard that animals are attracted to the smells of them and if they eat it they could die because tobacco is toxic. I also saw that someone earlier in the thread said that thier compost got contaminated from a neighbor dropping blunt guts out with the compost. I just assume that the stuff is better off in the trash. But I'm not a scientist either . lol	Wrapper is total asshole move but I’ve dumped blunt guts outside before. I assumed that it was dried leaves and okay but I guess there could be other Chems bad to the environment so My bad if that’s the case.    Are blunt guts bad for the environment?	None	0

gjualo7	Don't believe his lies!	getting fucked is fun when it feels fair	Dude I dont know how getting absolutely obliterated in games like this isnt fun to people, like seriously some of the funniest moments come from being absolutely fucked lol	There was a zeus in my old unit that had the policy that if we brought launchers we would get armour. That worked great until we had an op to take out an AA firebase. What he failed to tell us was that the AA was shilkas in an open courtyard with fire on infantry orders. After the op the guys ripped into him and most people stopped going to his ops.	None	0
gjubhji	The Qanon crowd is realizing there’s no storm coming	The lizard people stuff was made up by trolls. Anybody remember the name of the fiction people would make up, for lulz, to explain current events?	I still don't think the whole QAnon thing was real.  I think it was made up by trolls to see how much stupid shit they could get people to believe.	Four years of faith in internet strangers over their own friends and families is ending exactly as expected.	None	0

gjus5sr	How did America pass up Bernie Sanders twice?	Yeah. America’s Red Scare culture makes anyone who the word socialist unelectable to most centrist voters, regardless of actual policy.	I know this is a pro-Bernie forum, but I really wonder what would have happened if he hadnt insisted on calling himself a democratic socialist. All he had to say was, Im an FDR Democrat. I understand pretty well the way corporate America stacks the deck for itself, but if were being adults, Bernie himself shares some responsibility for not getting over the finish line.  Two points for shifting the Overton window so much, but perhaps it would have been better if hed actually gotten into office.	None	None	0
gjv05kt	[MoringMark] The Author of the Good Witch Azura	Well, we know from Gravity Falls easter eggs that beings from the R&amp;M universe have shown up before, and the Boiling Isles is referenced in one of GF's graphic novels, so it's not a farfetched idea.  Guess we'll leave the fanfic authors to figure out the rest!	Tbh i expected Rick Sanchez to appear... i know i have a strange imagination even tho its possible that rick and morty exist in the same universe as gravity falls and TOH	Was anyone else expecting a Gravity Falls reference, or was it just me?  Also, it's a pretty hilarious poke at the (admittedly absurd) time travel theory.	None	0
gjv2je0	Land transfer tax on mortgage transfer?	The issue in this case is the mortgage, since OP is basically doing a switcheroo with the lenders and the uncle/gf wherein the end result is,  it's as if the gf assumed the uncles share of the outstanding mortgage. At least in Ontario, the LTTA treats that as consideration.	Nope you do not. I was in a similar situation and did not pay land transfer tax.   Edit 2:  this only applies as long as there is no consideration (I.e. if you uncle isnt selling his share to you) AND no one else is going on the title	None	Oh yes. My mistake i totally didn’t see the gf going on title. I’ll correct my earlier comment	0
gjv8azq	Over five minutes of toilet paper tactical reload compilation but in Half-Life: Alyx	What I always remind people is that the Vive/Rift was the beginning. It just gets better from here and already has.	God VR is amazing lol. Imagine this in a decade.	None	None	0

gjvaq37	Thoughts on Socialist Yugoslavia	Great =/= somewhat decent.  I'll be honest, I would have preferred to have lived during  those times and actually make use of the yugoslav passport to emigrate outside to Canada. During those times, it was far easier to emigrate, especially with yugoslav passports.   I would have dragged my parents there and save them from alot of pain. With the Canadian health care system  my father would have been alive today.	It's interesting how everybody says that the period between the years 1968 and 1980 were great for albanians.	The only somewhat decent period for Albanians in Yugoslavia was between 1968 and 1980.  Before and after, the serbian fascist hogs ruined lives and terrorized albanians with the aim to ethnically cleanse it and colonize it.  Serbs really just wanted to ethnically cleanse land that they had gained by being gifted by Western and Eastern empires.  It's if serbia after losing the last war,  or Montenegro after declesirng independence, was forced to relinquish land to Albania or Kosovo and the state decides to ethnically cleanse the new lands.  The obsession with kosovo is just that.	Oh am sorry for your loss may he rest in peace. Also why Canada many European countries have great Healthcare?	0
gjvg9qv	Put the bomb... Where?!	Haha my favorite task on source checking is seeing where the trail of research leads, sometimes it’s think tanks and sometimes you gotta look up who the donors of those think tanks are to get a good understanding of the narrative they’re trying to come up with at a high level only to bury it in their “research”.	The David Horowitz Freedom Center is a widely recognized anti-islamic hate group.	None	None	0
gjvjaxo	Year after year after year...	Gift him his shorts.	Nope, secret santa assignments are random, as are the gifts NPCs give you.   I always get pissed when Lewis assigns me to be his secret santa himself, definitely not an abuse of power.	Wait what? Shane gave me a tea set for the evening star festival thing for the first year, I thought that was everybody? Same with getting Penny as your gift-ee for the secret Santa thing?	None	0

gjvm6pd	that's just how the cookie crumbles	Use a metal or glass mixing bowl and put it in the preheating oven while you prep the other ingredients. Ideally set a timer too, but you should hopefully get reminded about it once you've got the other stuff ready and can't find the butter .... hopefully.	I like to put the butter into the mixing bowl to soften and leave it on the counter for 2 weeks.	None	None	0
gjvmatj	It's hilarious that people get this shit done, but even more hilarious that Toe encourages it. Full on the inside forearm, too, no regrets in the mail for the dude that got this, that's for sure.	Those black lines are the chemical structure for DMT because of course...	I never noticed that being a chimp either... I was trying to figure out wtf was going on. You are correct tho. Just stuck a chimp face to the side of rogan face. I wonder What the black thick lines around the eyes and shit are.. Is that what blends the two together so its not two completely different tattoos beside each other.	Wtf even is this? So it’s Joe, but with one fucked up and drippy eye. And then a small eye on the side of his face u can barely notice? Oh shit I just noticed that’s an apes face from the side. Fuck this looks terrible. The chimp’s mouth looks like Toe has a cut ball sack hanging off his chin.	None	0
