In another post in this thread you talk about the slippery slope being a fallacy but you're already halfway down it with wanting to run off color activations on cards.,"That's definitely fair.  That you took the time to read what I wrote is what matters.  It is a shame I couldn't sway your opinion, but it is what it is.


In my opinion I don't think changing how Colour Identity interacts with Hybrid cards is in any way is against the spirit of the format.  I'll concede that my suggestion for the 2-brid cards was probably a bad one.  I can agree that they should stay as their singular colours instead of my idea of making them colourless.  However with concerns to the fun of deck building for the format, I have always found some restrictions non-sensical.  Why can I only play [[Scapheap Scrounger]] in a Black deck?  Why do I have to be running White **and** Red to play Archangel Avacyn?  I think that the current rules around Colour Identity are in some aspects too restrictive and actually ruin some of the fun that could be had in the deckbuilding process.","Colour identity isn’t a magic rule. It’s a Commander specific rule, it doesn’t need to follow the original functionality of the intended purpose of hybrid cards. It’s against the spirit of the format. There isn’t really a strong enough argument to change what we are already doing. And if you think that extort is confusing, how about playing a Beseech the Queen in a white deck. It would burn my eyes to see that. Lol. A lot of the fun of the format is being restricted and having to make cuts to fine tune your deck and make it function smoothly in your chosen colours. You have a great article with well thought out reasons , I just don’t agree with them and I don’t think it’s a strong enough argument to change.","I don't want to splash colours at all.  What I want is for what I can and can't play in a deck to match up properly with what I should be able to actually cast based on my deck's Colour Identity.  If I pick a Mono Blue deck, I should be able to use every card printed where I can pay for all costs on the card with a Mono-Island mana base.  If I am playing a Temur deck, and card printed where I can pay for all costs on the card when my mana only consists of Forests, Islands, and Mountains are all cards I should be able to play.


While yes [[Worldpurge]] is a White and Blue card, I should be able to have it in my Temur Commander deck because I am able to still properly play the card without needing a single White source in my deck.  And to expand this into mentioning abilities as well, If my deck is Gruul, I don't think I should be able to run Alesha.  Sure I'd have the Red to actually cast the card, but because I wouldn't be able to have the White or Black mana for it's abilities with an all Basic mana base, I can't run the card in the deck.  But if instead of Gruul I was playing Boros of Rakdos, suddenly I do have that White or Black mana and thus Alesha should be legal.",0,,,a user should be able to play how they want if they pay

It claimed that the Muria, a tribe in India, achieved marital bliss because kids were allowed to experiment sexually with one another at an early age (the low divorce rate it cited as evidence is in fact due to the tribe's arranged marriages and the woman's lack of say in them - a fact the text conveniently omits).

*""He who fights monsters should see to it that he himself does not become a monster. And if you gaze for long into an abyss, the abyss gazes also into you.""*

— Friedrich Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil

The means does not always justify the end, no matter how much 'good' the end does.",None,"I assume you are referring to both of my arguments. Which, argument wise, are not foolproof on their own. You asked for my *thoughts*, however, and hence I did put that kind of thought into them.

Let me attempt to amend that.

First, I am a firm believer that your actions influence your disposition. If you commit good acts, truly meaning them, you generally tend to lean towards the 'good' side of the spectrum. Similarly, if you commit horrid acts you tend to start leaning towards that end of the spectrum.

I believe this because, well, doing these things has an effect on your mental health. I feel better when I do good things and worse when I do bad things. And, to be really honest, once I start doing things I know are 'bad' it becomes easier to do the next 'bad' thing. Not everyone is like that, sure, but I'm sure it is relatable to many.

That's a micro-level thing, though. And, tbh, I can't be arsed to find the psychology to support it. I'm elbow deep in an academic paper and you caught me on one of my breaks.

But, for a moment, let us assume that what I mentioned plays a *part*. This part can snowball. 

Hypothetically, the protagonist alters the mind of *one* antagonist. It goes *smashingly*. The antagonist can't even connect with the actions they performed in the past, in fact, and for all intents and purposes are a changed (wo)man. It is reasonable to assume the protagonist, when faced with *another* antagonist, reflects back on the first antagonist and realizes they can do it *again*. So, they do. It, again, goes smashingly. 

Rinse and repeat, this becomes procedure. The protagonist, when faced with someone who is an oppositional force, simply forcibly changes the mind of their opponent. Not only do they do that, but their opponent probably *thanks* them for helping them see the error of their ways.

How long do you think it takes the protagonist to realize it doesn't **have** to be a dangerous opponent? That, if they really want, **anyone** whose mind they want to change can be changed. They just have to have a reason to convince the one who does this procedure to do it OR, if they do it, a good enough reason to keep the public from mutinying must be formed. That is all. 

The potential for the first instance to snowball into others is *part* what makes it so immoral. One mind altered, while heinous, can be an exception. But just like the first time you call out of work, once you've discovered you can do this and have it be okay... It would be hard not to put that action into your toolbox from now on.

The second reason I think this action is immoral is that it takes away free will. The antagonist did not change on their own, they were essentially brainwashed into compliance. Only it's worse, really, because unlike typical brainwashing there is no way to *undo* what has been done. The personality of a human being was irrevocably changed without their *consent*. If the antagonist had consented, for whatever odd reason, the action would be moral as it does not take away their free will as their altered state **is** their will. 

I know you will argue that in real life peoples rights are invalidated. I agree with that, I will concede that it does indeed happen. However, we never take away the rights of people to be who they are. We take away the right of those people to take actions to *express* who they are but we never change who they are.

Third, it reeks of a God complex. Again, as I stated in the first reason section, this becomes a tool the protagonist leans upon rather heavily if they run into situations where they need to use it. If they don't view it as wrong, of course, which you suggest they do not. This kind of ability gives them a power over others that is unprecedented. Power tends to corrupt people. And, in this case, I am sure this corruption allows the protagonist to think it is their *right* to perform this action. Anyone they do it to, they deserve it. They can meddle with whoever they please. They think themselves above all others, above outside interference, and will not be convinced otherwise.",1,"if you gaze for long into an abyss, the abyss gazes also into you.","[(144, 146), (147, 150), (151, 155), (156, 159), (160, 164), (165, 169), (170, 172), (173, 178), (178, 179), (180, 183), (184, 189), (190, 195), (196, 200), (201, 205), (206, 210)]","Thinking about something too much, even if you don't do it, makes you evil"

I've loved the internet for 23+ years because it's been a place you didn't need to censor yourself like you do in public. FB started eroding that. And now it's crept into places like reddit.

The addiction is the *slippery* slope. What you're talking about are cases where people assume the mere existence of a slope (weed -&gt; heroin) to imply that the final outcome is inevitable (i.e ""slippery""). Improper application is an issue for every popular fallacy, but that doesn't mean that the fallacy should not be used at all.","Heroin is a better example, as it usually is a main cause for a heroin addiction(who would’ve thought). However, the addiction is usually what people would say the last part of the slope is. So the addiction is event 12, and event 1 is like smoking weed once. Since event 1 is technically the cause of event 12, event one, in this argument, is inherently bad. However, a lot of people ignore the 10 other steps between weed and heroin.","It might be overused but it is far from illogical.  A ‘slippery slope’ describes a real world phenomenon. 

To illustrate, I’d describe taking heroin as a slippery slope. It is incredibly addictive and makes it difficult to function in other areas of life. 

It is not a forgone conclusion that someone who tries it will end up an addict, losing their job, friends and family...but the decision to take it once greatly increases the chances of that occurring.
